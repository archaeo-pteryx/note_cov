        demonstrate its accuracy in describing the monopole, quadrupole,
        and hexadecapole of the galaxy density field down to scales of k
        = 0.4 hMpc$^{-1}$. The model describes the clustering of
        galaxies in the context of a halo model and the clustering of
        the underlying halos in redshift space using a combination of
        Eulerian perturbation theory and N-body simulations. The
        modeling of redshift-space distortions is done using the so-
        called distribution function approach. The final model has 13
        free parameters, and each parameter is physically motivated
        rather than a nuisance parameter, which allows the use of well-
        motivated priors. We account for the Finger-of-God effect from
        centrals and both isolated and non-isolated satellites rather
        than using a single velocity dispersion to describe the combined
        effect. We test and validate the accuracy of the model on
        several sets of high-fidelity N-body simulations, as well as
        realistic mock catalogs designed to simulate the BOSS DR12 CMASS
        data set. The suite of simulations covers a range of cosmologies
        and galaxy bias models, providing a rigorous test of the level
        of theoretical systematics present in the model. The level of
        bias in the recovered values of f {\ensuremath{\sigma}}$_{8}$ is
        found to be small. When including scales to k = 0.4 hMpc$^{-1}$,
        we find 15-30\% gains in the statistical precision of f
        {\ensuremath{\sigma}}$_{8}$ relative to k = 0.2 hMpc$^{-1}$ and
        a roughly 10-15\% improvement for the perpendicular Alcock-
        Paczynski parameter {\ensuremath{\alpha}}$_{‚ä•}$. Using the BOSS
        DR12 CMASS mocks as a benchmark for comparison, we estimate an
        uncertainty on f {\ensuremath{\sigma}}$_{8}$ that is
        \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde10-20\% larger than other
        similar Fourier-space RSD models in the literature that use k

        sufficient volume to make precision predictions for clustering
        on cosmologically relevant scales. Here, we use our new
        IllustrisTNG simulations to study the non-linear correlation
        functions and power spectra of baryons, dark matter, galaxies,
        and haloes over an exceptionally large range of scales. We find
        that baryonic effects increase the clustering of dark matter on
        small scales and damp the total matter power spectrum on scales
        up to k\CID{1} 10 h Mpc$^{-1}$ by 20 per cent. The non-linear two-
        point correlation function of the stellar mass is close to a
        power-law over a wide range of scales and approximately
        invariant in time from very high redshift to the present. The
        two-point correlation function of the simulated galaxies agrees
        well with Sloan Digital Sky Survey at its mean redshift z \UTF{2243} 0.1,
        both as a function of stellar mass and when split according to
        galaxy colour, apart from a mild excess in the clustering of red
        galaxies in the stellar mass range of{}10$^{9}$-{}10$^{10}$
        h$^{-2}$ M$_{\UTF{2609}}$. Given this agreement, the TNG simulations can
        make valuable theoretical predictions for the clustering bias of
        different galaxy samples. We find that the clustering length of
        the galaxy autocorrelation function depends strongly on stellar
        mass and redshift. Its power-law slope {\ensuremath{\gamma}} is
        nearly invariant with stellar mass, but declines from
        {\ensuremath{\gamma}}\CID{1} 1.8 at redshift z = 0 to
        {\ensuremath{\gamma}}\CID{1} 1.6 at redshift z\CID{1} 1, beyond which the
        slope steepens again. We detect significant scale dependences in
        the bias of different observational tracers of large-scale
        structure, extending well into the range of the baryonic
        acoustic oscillations and causing nominal (yet fortunately
        correctable) shifts of the acoustic peaks of around\CID{1} 5 per

        parameters by breaking the degeneracy between galaxy bias and
        the amplitude of clustering signal. In a series of two papers,
        we perform such an analysis at the highest redshift (\CID{91} 0.53) in
        the literature using CMASS galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky
        Survey-III Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey Eleventh Data
        Release (BOSS DR11) catalog spanning 8300 deg$^{2}$. In this
        paper, we present details of the clustering and weak lensing
        measurements of these galaxies. We define a subsample of 400,916
        CMASS galaxies based on their redshifts and stellar-mass
        estimates so that the galaxies constitute an approximately
        volume-limited and similar population over the redshift range

        available shape and photometric redshift catalogs from CFHTLenS,
        but only in a 105 deg$^{2}$ area that overlaps with BOSS. This
        restricts the lensing measurement to only 5084 CMASS galaxies.
        After careful systematic tests, we find a highly significant
        detection of the CMASS weak lensing signal, with total S/N \UTF{2243} 26.

        $M_\star\sim3.5\times10^9\,{\rm M}_\odot$, respectively, in
        hosts more massive than $10^{11}\,{\rm M}_\odot$. Consistent
        with previous work, we find that haloes located in dense
        environments, with low concentrations, later formation times,
        and high angular momenta are richest in their satellite
        population. At low mass, highly-concentrated haloes and those
        located in overdense regions are more likely to contain a
        central galaxy. The degree of environmental dependence is
        sensitive to the definition adopted for the physical boundary of
        the host halo. We examine the extent to which correlations
        between galaxy occupancy and halo properties are independent and
        demonstrate that HODs predicted by halo mass and present-day
        concentration capture the qualitative dependence on the
        remaining halo properties. At fixed halo mass, concentration is
        a strong predictor of the stellar mass of the central galaxy,
        which may play a defining role in the fate of the satellite
        population. The radial distribution of satellite galaxies, which
        exhibits a universal form across a wide range of host halo mass,
        is described accurately by the best-fit NFW density profile of
        their host haloes.}",

     abstract = "{The halo occupation distribution (HOD) describes the bias between
        galaxies and dark matter by specifying (1) the probability
        P(N|M) that a halo of virial mass M contains N galaxies of a
        particular class and (2) the relative spatial and velocity
        distributions of galaxies and dark matter within halos. We
        calculate and compare the HODs predicted by a smoothed particle
        hydrodynamics (SPH) simulation of a {\ensuremath{\Lambda}}CDM
        cosmological model (cold dark matter with a cosmological
        constant) and by a semianalytic galaxy formation model applied
        to the same cosmology. Although the two methods predict
        different galaxy mass functions, their HOD predictions for
        samples of the same space density agree remarkably well. In a
        sample defined by a baryonic mass threshold, the mean occupation
        function \&lt;N\&gt;$_{M}$ exhibits a sharp cutoff at low halo
        masses, a slowly rising plateau in which \&lt;N\&gt; climbs from
        1 to 2 over nearly a decade in halo mass, and a more steeply
        rising high-occupancy regime at high halo mass. In the low-
        occupancy regime, the factorial moments \&lt;N(N-1)\&gt; and
        \&lt;N(N-1)(N-2)\&gt; are well below the values of
        \&lt;N\&gt;$^{2}$ and \&lt;N\&gt;$^{3}$ expected for Poisson
        statistics, with important consequences for the small-scale
        behavior of the two- and three-point correlation functions. The
        HOD depends strongly on galaxy age, with high-mass halos
        populated mainly by old galaxies and low-mass halos by young
        galaxies. The distribution of galaxies within SPH halos supports
        the assumptions usually made in semianalytic calculations: the
        most massive galaxy lies close to the halo center and moves near
        the halo's mean velocity, while the remaining, satellite
        galaxies have the same radial profile and velocity dispersion as
        the dark matter. The mean occupation at fixed halo mass in the
        SPH simulation is independent of the halo's larger scale
        environment, supporting both the merger tree approach of the
        semianalytic method and the claim that the HOD provides a
        complete statistical characterization of galaxy bias. We discuss
        the connections between the predicted HODs and the galaxy
        formation physics incorporated in the SPH and semianalytic
        approaches. These predictions offer useful guidance to
        theoretical models of galaxy clustering, and they will be tested
        empirically by ongoing analyses of galaxy redshift surveys. By
        applying the HODs to a large-volume N-body simulation, we show
        that both methods predict slight departures from a power-law
        galaxy correlation function, similar to features detected in
        recent observational analyses.}",

        formation time, density profile concentration, and subhalo
        occupation number, using high-resolution numerical simulations
        of a {\ensuremath{\Lambda}}CDM cosmology. We confirm results
        that halo clustering is a function of halo formation time at
        fixed mass and that this trend depends on halo mass. For the
        first time, we show unequivocally that halo clustering is a
        function of halo concentration and show that the dependence of
        halo bias on concentration, mass, and redshift can be accurately
        parameterized in a simple way:
        b(M,c|z)=b(M|z)b$_{c<SUB>vir}$</SUB>(c|M/M$_{*}$).
        Interestingly, the scaling between bias and concentration
        changes sign with the value of M/M$_{*}$: high-concentration
        (early forming) objects cluster more strongly for
        M\&lt;\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitildeM$_{*}$, while low-

        the halo occupation number (of dark matter subhalos) at fixed
        mass and discuss implications for halo model calculations of
        dark matter power spectra and galaxy clustering statistics. The
        effect of these halo properties on clustering is strongest for
        early-forming dwarf-mass halos, which are significantly more
        clustered than typical halos of their mass. Our results suggest
        that isolated low-mass galaxies (e.g., low surface brightness
        dwarfs) should have more slowly rising rotation curves than
        their more clustered counterparts and may have consequences for
        the dearth of dwarf galaxies in voids. They also imply that
        self-calibrating richness-selected cluster samples with their
        clustering properties might overestimate cluster masses and bias
        cosmological parameter estimation.}",

        This can also be seen in the monopole and quadrupole of the

        While the RSD on small scales (e.g. a few to tens of h\^\{-1\}
        \{Mpc\}) can further tighten the f{\ensuremath{\sigma}}$_{8}$
        constraints, galaxy assembly bias, if not correctly modelled,

        not. However, the f{\ensuremath{\sigma}}$_{8}$ metrics
        determined from central galaxies from all the models are able to
        match the expected one down to 8 h\^\{-1\} \{Mpc\}. Our results
        suggest that halo models with no or an incorrect assembly bias
        prescription could still be used to model the RSD down to scales
        of 8 h\^\{-1\} \{Mpc\} to tighten the

        derived from a sample of luminous red galaxies (LRGs) from the

        halo power spectrum has a direct connection to the underlying
        dark matter power for k \&lt;= 0.2hMpc$^{-1}$, well into the
        quasi-linear regime. This enables us to use a factor of
        \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde8 more modes in the cosmological
        analysis than an analysis with k$_{max}$ = 0.1hMpc$^{-1}$, as
        was adopted in the SDSS team analysis of the DR4 LRG sample. The
        observed halo power spectrum for 0.02 \&lt; k \&lt;
        0.2hMpc$^{-1}$ is well fitted by our model:
        {\ensuremath{\chi}}$^{2}$ = 39.6 for 40 degrees of freedom for
        the best-fitting {\ensuremath{\Lambda}} cold dark matter
        ({\ensuremath{\Lambda}}CDM) model. We find

        0.141$^{+0.010}$$_{-0.012}$ for a power-law primordial power
        spectrum with spectral index n$_{s}$ and
        {\ensuremath{\Omega}}$_{b}$h$^{2}$ = 0.02265 fixed, consistent
        with cosmic microwave background measurements. The halo power
        spectrum also constrains the ratio of the comoving sound horizon
        at the baryon-drag epoch to an effective distance to z = 0.35:
        r$_{s}$/D$_{V}$(0.35) = 0.1097$^{+0.0039}$$_{-0.0042}$.
        Combining the halo power spectrum measurement with the Wilkinson
        Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) 5 year results, for the flat

        {\ensuremath{\Omega}}$_{m}$ = 0.289 +/- 0.019 and H$_{0}$ = 69.4
        +/- 1.6kms$^{-1}$Mpc$^{-1}$. Allowing for massive neutrinos in
        {\ensuremath{\Lambda}}CDM, we find eV at the 95 per cent
        confidence level. If we instead consider the effective number of
        relativistic species N$_{eff}$ as a free parameter, we find
        N$_{eff}$ = 4.8$^{+1.8}$$_{-1.7}$. Combining also with the

        Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) will conduct novel
        cosmological observations using the BOSS spectrograph at Apache
        Point Observatory. These observations will be conducted
        simultaneously with the Time Domain Spectroscopic Survey (TDSS)
        designed for variability studies and the Spectroscopic
        Identification of eROSITA Sources (SPIDERS) program designed for
        studies of X-ray sources. In particular, eBOSS will measure with
        percent-level precision the distance-redshift relation with
        baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in the clustering of matter.
        eBOSS will use four different tracers of the underlying matter
        density field to vastly expand the volume covered by BOSS and
        map the large-scale-structures over the relatively unconstrained
        redshift range 0.6 \&lt; z \&lt; 2.2. Using more than 250,000
        new, spectroscopically confirmed luminous red galaxies at a
        median redshift z = 0.72, we project that eBOSS will yield
        measurements of the angular diameter distance d$_{A}$(z) to an
        accuracy of 1.2\% and measurements of H(z) to 2.1\% when
        combined with the z \&gt; 0.6 sample of BOSS galaxies. With
       \CID{1}195,000 new emission line galaxy redshifts, we expect BAO
        measurements of d$_{A}$(z) to an accuracy of 3.1\% and H(z) to
        4.7\% at an effective redshift of z = 0.87. A sample of more
        than 500,000 spectroscopically confirmed quasars will provide
        the first BAO distance measurements over the redshift range 0.9
        \&lt; z \&lt; 2.2, with expected precision of 2.8\% and 4.2\% on
        d$_{A}$(z) and H(z), respectively. Finally, with 60,000 new
        quasars and re-observation of 60,000 BOSS quasars, we will
        obtain new Ly{\ensuremath{\alpha}} forest measurements at
        redshifts z \&gt; 2.1 these new data will enhance the precision
        of d$_{A}$(z) and H(z) at z \&gt; 2.1 by a factor of 1.44
        relative to BOSS. Furthermore, eBOSS will provide improved tests
        of General Relativity on cosmological scales through redshift-
        space distortion measurements, improved tests for non-
        Gaussianity in the primordial density field, and new constraints
        on the summed mass of all neutrino species. Here, we provide an

        to be a powerful observable quantity of future large redshift
        surveys to probe physical properties of dark energy and to
        distinguish among various gravity theories. We investigate
        systematic effects on determination of the linear growth factor
        f from a measurement of redshift-space distortions. Using a
        large set of high-resolution N-body simulations, we identify
        dark matter halos over a broad mass range. We compute the power
        spectra and correlation functions for the halos and then
        investigate how well the redshift distortion parameter
        {\ensuremath{\beta}} {\ensuremath{\equiv}} f/b can be
        reconstructed as a function of halo mass both in Fourier and in
        configuration space, where b is the bias parameter. We find that
        the {\ensuremath{\beta}} value thus measured for a fixed halo
        mass generally is a function of scale for k\&gt;0.02 h
        Mpc$^{-1}$ in Fourier space or r \&lt; 80 h $^{-1}$ Mpc in
        configuration space, in contrast with the common expectation
        that {\ensuremath{\beta}} approaches a constant described by
        Kaiser's formula on the large scales. The scale dependence
        depends on the halo mass, being stronger for smaller halos. It
        is complex and cannot be easily explained with the exponential
        distribution function in configuration space or with the Lorentz
        function in Fourier space of the halo peculiar velocities. We
        demonstrate that the biasing for smaller halos has larger
        nonlinearity and stochasticity, thus the linear bias assumption
        adopted in Kaiser's derivation becomes worse for smaller halos.
        Only for massive halos with the bias parameter b \&gt;= 1.5 does
        the {\ensuremath{\beta}} value approach the constant predicted
        by the linear theory on scales of k \&lt; 0.08 h Mpc$^{-1}$ or
        r\&gt;30 h $^{-1}$ Mpc. Luminous red galaxies (LRGs), targeted
        by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the SDSS-III's Baryon
        Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS), tend to reside in very
        massive halos. Our results indicate that if the central LRG
        sample is used for the measurement of redshift-space
        distortions, the linear growth factor can fortunately be
        measured unbiasedly. On the other hand, emission-line galaxies,
        targeted by some future redshift surveys such as the BigBOSS
        survey, are inhabited in halos of a broad mass range. If one
        considers using such galaxies, the scale dependence of
        {\ensuremath{\beta}} must be taken into account carefully;
        otherwise, one might give incorrect constraints on dark energy
        or modified gravity theories. We also find that the
        {\ensuremath{\beta}} reconstructed in Fourier space behaves
        fairly better than that in configuration space when compared
        with the linear theory prediction.}",

     abstract = "{Theoretical modeling of the redshift-space power spectrum of galaxies is
        crucially important to correctly extract cosmological
        information from galaxy redshift surveys. The task is
        complicated by the nonlinear biasing and redshift space
        distortion (RSD) effects, which change with halo mass, and by
        the wide distribution of halo masses and their occupations by
        galaxies. One of the main modeling challenges is the existence
        of satellite galaxies that have both radial distribution inside
        the halos and large virial velocities inside halos, a phenomenon
        known as the Finger-of-God (FoG) effect. We present a model for
        the redshift-space power spectrum of galaxies in which we
        decompose a given galaxy sample into central and satellite
        galaxies and relate different contributions to the power
        spectrum to 1-halo and 2-halo terms in a halo model. Our primary
        goal is to ensure that any parameters that we introduce have
        physically meaningful values, and are not just fitting
        parameters. For the lowest order 2-halo terms we use the
        previously developed RSD modeling of halos in the context of
        distribution function and perturbation theory approach. This
        term needs to be multiplied by the effect of radial distances
        and velocities of satellites inside the halo. To this one needs
        to add the 1-halo terms, which are nonperturbative. We show that
        the real space 1-halo terms can be modeled as almost constant,
        with the finite extent of the satellites inside the halo
        inducing a small k$^{2}$R$^{2}$ term over the range of scales of
        interest, where R is related to the size of the halo given by
        its halo mass. We adopt a similar model for FoG in redshift
        space, ensuring that FoG velocity dispersion is related to the
        halo mass. For FoG k$^{2}$ type expansions do not work over the
        range of scales of interest and FoG resummation must be used
        instead. We test several simple damping functions to model the
        velocity dispersion FoG effect. Applying the formalism to mock
        galaxies modeled after the ``CMASS'' sample of the BOSS survey,
        we find that our predictions for the redshift-space power
        spectra are accurate up to k \UTF{2243}0.4 h Mpc$^{-1}$ within 1\% if the
        halo power spectrum is measured using N -body simulations and
        within 3\% if it is modeled using perturbation theory.}",

        The survey, which uses the Subaru Telescope and covers a
        redshift range of 1.19 \&lt; z \&lt; 1.55, is the first
        cosmological study at such high redshifts. We detect clear
        anisotropy due to redshift-space distortions (RSD) both in the
        correlation function as a function of separations parallel and
        perpendicular to the line of sight and its quadrupole moment.
        RSD has been extensively used to test general relativity on
        cosmological scales at z \&lt; 1. Adopting a
        {\ensuremath{\Lambda}}CDM cosmology with the fixed expansion
        history and no velocity dispersion ({\ensuremath{\sigma}}$_{v}$
        = 0), and using the RSD measurements on scales above 8 h$^{-1}$
        Mpc, we obtain the first constraint on the growth rate at the
        redshift, f (z){\ensuremath{\sigma}}$_{8}$(z) = 0.482
        {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.116 at z\CID{1} 1.4 after marginalizing over the
        galaxy bias parameter b(z){\ensuremath{\sigma}}$_{8}$(z). This
        corresponds to 4.2 {\ensuremath{\sigma}} detection of RSD. Our
        constraint is consistent with the prediction of general
        relativity f{\ensuremath{\sigma}}$_{8}$\CID{1} 0.392 within the 1
        {\ensuremath{\sigma}} confidence level. When we allow
        {\ensuremath{\sigma}}$_{v}$ to vary and marginalize over it, the
        growth rate constraint becomes f{\ensuremath{\sigma}}
        \_8=0.494\^\{+0.126\}\_\{-0.120\}. We also demonstrate that by
        combining with the low-z constraints on

     abstract = "{We present the general real- and redshift-space clustering properties of
        galaxies as measured in the first data release of the VIPERS
        survey. VIPERS is a large redshift survey designed to probe in
        detail the distant Universe and its large-scale structure at 0.5
        \&lt; z \&lt; 1.2. We describe in this analysis the global
        properties of the sample and discuss the survey completeness and
        associated corrections. This sample allows us to measure the
        galaxy clustering with an unprecedented accuracy at these
        redshifts. From the redshift-space distortions observed in the
        galaxy clustering pattern we provide a first measurement of the
        growth rate of structure at z = 0.8:
        f{\ensuremath{\sigma}}$_{8}$ = 0.47 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.08.
        This is completely consistent with the predictions of standard
        cosmological models based on Einstein gravity, although this
        measurement alone does not discriminate between different
        gravity models. Based on observations collected at the European
        Southern Observatory, Cerro Paranal, Chile, using the Very Large
        Telescope under programmes 182.A-0886 and partly 070.A-9007.
        Also based on observations obtained with MegaPrime/MegaCam, a
        joint project of CFHT and CEA/DAPNIA, at the Canada-France-
        Hawaii Telescope (CFHT), which is operated by the National
        Research Council (NRC) of Canada, the Institut National des
        Sciences de l'Univers of the Centre National de la Recherche
        Scientifique (CNRS) of France, and the University of Hawaii.
        This work is based in part on data products produced at TERAPIX
        and the Canadian Astronomy Data Centre as part of the Canada-
        France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey, a collaborative project

        properties measured in the Lagrangian space of the initial
        linear Gaussian random density field and show how these same
        Lagrangian properties determine large-scale bias. We focus on
        the two regimes where assembly bias has been observed to be
        significant: at masses very large and very small compared to the
        nonlinear mass scale. At high masses, we show that assembly bias
        is expected from the statistics of the peaks of Gaussian random
        fluctuations, and we show that the extent of assembly bias found
        in N-body simulations of rare halos is in excellent agreement
        with our theoretical prediction. At low masses, we argue that
        assembly bias largely arises from a subpopulation of low-mass
        halos whose mass accretion has ceased. Due to their arrested
        development, these halos naturally become unbiased, in contrast
        to their antibiased peers. We show that a simple toy model
        incorporating these effects can roughly reproduce the bias
        trends found in N-body simulations.}",

	Abstract = {We study the generation of vorticity and velocity dispersion by orbit crossing using cosmological numerical simulations, and calculate the backreaction of these effects on the evolution of large-scale density and velocity divergence power spectra. We use Delaunay tessellations to define the velocity field, showing that the power spectra of velocity divergence and vorticity measured in this way are unbiased and have better noise properties than for standard interpolation methods that deal with mass weighted velocities. We show that high resolution simulations are required to recover the correct large-scale vorticity power spectrum, while poor resolution can spuriously amplify its amplitude by more than one order of magnitude. We measure the scalar and vector modes of the stress tensor induced by orbit crossing using an adaptive technique, showing that its vector modes lead, when input into the vorticity evolution equation, to the same vorticity power spectrum obtained from the Delaunay method. We incorporate orbit crossing corrections to the evolution of large scale density and velocity fields in perturbation theory by using the measured stress tensor modes. We find that at large scales (k~0.1 h/Mpc) vector modes have very little effect in the density power spectrum, while scalar modes (velocity dispersion) can induce percent level corrections at z=0, particularly in the velocity divergence power spectrum. In addition, we show that the velocity power spectrum is smaller than predicted by linear theory until well into the nonlinear regime, with little contribution from virial velocities.},

	Abstract = {We demonstrate that the output of a cosmological N-body
		  simulation can, to remarkable accuracy, be scaled to
		  represent the growth of large-scale structure in a
		  cosmology with parameters similar to but different from
		  those originally assumed. Our algorithm involves three
		  steps: a reassignment of length, mass and velocity units; a
		  relabelling of the time axis and a rescaling of the
		  amplitudes of individual large-scale fluctuation modes. We
		  test it using two matched pairs of simulations. Within each
		  pair, one simulation assumes parameters consistent with
		  analyses of the first-year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy
		  Probe (WMAP) data. The other has lower matter and baryon
		  densities and a 15 per cent lower fluctuation amplitude,
		  consistent with analyses of the three-year WMAP data. The
		  pairs differ by a factor of a thousand in mass resolution,
		  enabling performance tests on both linear and non-linear
		  scales. Our scaling reproduces the mass power spectra of
		  the target cosmology to better than 0.5 per cent on large
		  scales (k < 0.1hMpc-1) both in real and in redshift space.
		  In particular, the baryonic acoustic oscillation features
		  of the original cosmology are removed and are correctly
		  replaced by those of the target cosmology. Errors are still
		  below 3 per cent for k < 1hMpc-1. Power spectra of the dark
		  halo distribution are even more precisely reproduced, with
		  errors below 1 per cent on all scales tested. A
		  halo-by-halo comparison shows that centre-of-mass positions
		  and velocities are reproduced to better than 90h-1kpc and 5
		  per cent, respectively. Halo masses, concentrations and
		  spins are also reproduced at about the 10 per cent level,
		  although with small biases. Halo assembly histories are
		  accurately reproduced, leading to central galaxy magnitudes
		  with errors of about 0.25mag and a bias of about 0.13mag
		  for a representative semi-analytic model. This algorithm
		  will enable a systematic exploration of the coupling
		  between cosmological parameter estimates and uncertainties
		  in galaxy formation in future large-scale structure
		  surveys.},

	Abstract = {It has been proposed that the cosmological constant
		  {LAMBDA} might be measured from geometric effects on
		  large-scale structure. A positive vacuum density leads to
		  correlation function contours which are squashed in the
		  radial direction when calculated assuming a
		  matter-dominated model. We show that this effect will be
		  somewhat harder to detect than previous calculations have
		  suggested: the squashing factor is likely to be < 1.3,
		  given realistic constraints on the matter contribution to
		  {OMEGA}. Moreover, the geometrical distortion risks being
		  confused with the redshift-space distortions caused by the
		  peculiar velocities associated with the growth of galaxy
		  clustering. These depend on the density and bias parameters
		  via the combination beta = {OMEGA}^0.6/b, and we show that
		  the main practical effect of a geometrical flattening
		  factor F is to simulate gravitational instability with
		  B_eff_ ~ 0.5(F - 1). Nevertheless, with datasets of
		  sufficient size it is possible to distinguish the two
		  effects, We discuss in detail how this should be done, and
		  give a maximum-likelihood method for extracting {LAMBDA}
		  and betab from anisotropic power-spectrum data.
		  New-generation redshift surveys of galaxies and quasars are
		  potentially capable of detecting a non-zero vacuum density,
		  if it exists at a cosmologically interesting level.},

	Abstract = {We investigate galaxy bias in the framework of the ``halo
		  occupation distribution'' (HOD), which defines the bias of
		  a population of galaxies by the conditional probability
		  P(N|M) that a dark matter halo of virial mass M contains N
		  galaxies, together with prescriptions that specify the
		  relative spatial and velocity distributions of galaxies and
		  dark matter within halos. By populating the halos of a
		  cosmological N-body simulation using a variety of HOD
		  models, we examine the sensitivity of different galaxy
		  clustering statistics to properties of the HOD. The galaxy
		  correlation function responds to different aspects of
		  P(N|M) on different scales. Obtaining the observed
		  power-law form of xig(r) requires rather specific
		  combinations of HOD parameters, implying a strong
		  constraint on the physics of galaxy formation; the success
		  of numerical and semianalytic models in reproducing this
		  form is entirely nontrivial. Other clustering statistics
		  such as the galaxy-mass correlation function, the
		  bispectrum, the void probability function, the pairwise
		  velocity dispersion, and the group multiplicity function
		  are sensitive to different combinations of HOD parameters
		  and thus provide complementary information about galaxy
		  bias. We outline a strategy for determining the HOD
		  empirically from redshift survey data. This method starts
		  from an assumed cosmological model, but we argue that
		  cosmological and HOD parameters will have nondegenerate
		  effects on galaxy clustering, so that a substantially
		  incorrect cosmological model will not reproduce the
		  observations for any choice of HOD. Empirical
		  determinations of the HOD as a function of galaxy type from
		  the Two-Degree Field (2dF) and Sloan Digital Sky Survey
		  (SDSS) redshift surveys will provide a detailed target for
		  theories of galaxy formation, insight into the origin of
		  galaxy properties, and sharper tests of cosmological
		  models.},

		  of this effect. While the one-loop result eventually breaks
		  down, we show how the damping effect can be fully captured
		  by the help of the eikonal approximation. A relative
		  velocity not only induces mode damping but also creates
		  large-scale anisotropic modulations of the matter power
		  spectrum amplitude. We illustrate this for the Local Group

	Abstract = {We introduce the concept of multipoint propagators between
		  linear cosmic fields and their nonlinear counterparts in
		  the context of cosmological perturbation theory. Such
		  functions express how a nonlinearly evolved Fourier mode
		  depends on the full ensemble of modes in the initial
		  density field. We identify and resum the dominant diagrams
		  in the large-k limit, showing explicitly that multipoint
		  propagators decay into the nonlinear regime at the same
		  rate as the two-point propagator. These analytic results
		  generalize the large-k limit behavior of the two-point
		  propagator to arbitrary order. We measure the three-point
		  propagator as a function of triangle shape in numerical
		  simulations and confirm the results of our high-k
		  resummation. We show that any n-point spectrum can be
		  reconstructed from multipoint propagators, which leads to a
		  physical connection between nonlinear corrections to the
		  power spectrum at small scales and higher-order
		  correlations at large scales. As a first application of
		  these results, we calculate the reduced bispectrum at one
		  loop in renormalized perturbation theory and show that we
		  can predict the decrease in its dependence on triangle
		  shape at redshift zero, when standard perturbation theory
		  is least successful.},

	Abstract = {Landy & Szalay (1993) present a new estimator for angular
		  correlation functions, and an expression for the variance
		  of this estimator for the special case of
		  Poisson-distributed points. We extend their results to give
		  the variance of the estimator in the case of correlated
		  point sets and also derive the covariance between estimates
		  at different angular separations. These new covariance
		  formulae are accurate when the number of objects N is much

		  the covariance matrix depends upon the three- and

		  terms of the two-point correlation function if the
		  clustering follows a hierarchical form. Use of the Poisson
		  errors greatly misestimates the covariance matrix when N
		  becomes large and leads to underestimates of the
		  uncertainties on the fitted parameters of model correlation
		  functions. The new covariance matrix formula is shown to be

	Abstract = {We present a detailed analysis of redshift-space
		  distortions in the two-point correlation function of the
		  6dF Galaxy Survey (6dFGS). The K-band selected subsample
		  which we employ in this study contains 81 971 galaxies
		  distributed over 17 000 degree2 with an effective redshift
		  zeff= 0.067. By modelling the 2D galaxy correlation
		  function, ?, we measure the parameter combination
		  f(zeff)sigma8(zeff) = 0.423 $\pm$ 0.055, where ? is the
		  growth rate of cosmic structure and sigma8 is the rms of
		  matter fluctuations in 8 h-1 Mpc spheres. Alternatively, by
		  assuming standard gravity we can break the degeneracy
		  between sigma8 and the galaxy bias parameter b. Combining
		  our data with the Hubble constant prior from Riess et al.,
		  we measure sigma8= 0.76 $\pm$ 0.11 and Omegam= 0.250 $\pm$
		  0.022, consistent with constraints from other galaxy
		  surveys and the cosmic microwave background data from
		  Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe 7 (WMAP7). Combining
		  our measurement of fsigma8 with WMAP7 allows us to test the
		  cosmic growth history and the relationship between matter
		  and gravity on cosmic scales by constraining the growth
		  index of density fluctuations, gamma. Using only 6dFGS and
		  WMAP7 data we find gamma= 0.547 $\pm$ 0.088, consistent
		  with the prediction of General Relativity. We note that
		  because of the low effective redshift of the 6dFGS our
		  measurement of the growth rate is independent of the
		  fiducial cosmological model (Alcock-Paczynski effect). We
		  also show that our conclusions are not sensitive to the
		  model adopted for non-linear redshift-space distortions.
		  Using a Fisher matrix analysis we report predictions for
		  constraints on fsigma8 for the Wide-field Australian SKA
		  Pathfinder telescope L-band Legacy All-sky Blind surveY
		  (WALLABY) and the proposed Transforming Astronomical
		  Imaging surveys through Polychromatic Analysis of Nebulae
		  (TAIPAN) survey. The WALLABY survey will be able to measure
		  fsigma8 with a precision of 4-10 per cent, depending on the
		  modelling of non-linear structure formation. This is
		  comparable to the predicted precision for the best redshift
		  bins of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey,
		  demonstrating that low-redshift surveys have a significant
		  role to play in future tests of dark energy and modified
		  gravity.},

	Abstract = {We present precise measurements of the growth rate of
		  cosmic structure for the redshift range 0.1 < z < 0.9,
		  using redshift-space distortions in the galaxy power
		  spectrum of the WiggleZ Dark Energy Survey. Our results,
		  which have a precision of around 10 per cent in four
		  independent redshift bins, are well fitted by a flat Lambda
		  cold dark matter (LambdaCDM) cosmological model with matter
		  density parameter Omegam= 0.27. Our analysis hence
		  indicates that this model provides a self-consistent
		  description of the growth of cosmic structure through
		  large-scale perturbations and the homogeneous cosmic
		  expansion mapped by supernovae and baryon acoustic
		  oscillations. We achieve robust results by systematically
		  comparing our data with several different models of the
		  quasi-linear growth of structure including empirical
		  models, fitting formulae calibrated to N-body simulations,
		  and perturbation theory techniques. We extract the first
		  measurements of the power spectrum of the velocity
		  divergence field, Pthetatheta(k), as a function of redshift
		  (under the assumption that ?, where g is the galaxy
		  overdensity field), and demonstrate that the WiggleZ
		  galaxy-mass cross-correlation is consistent with a
		  deterministic (rather than stochastic) scale-independent
		  bias model for WiggleZ galaxies for scales k < 0.3 h Mpc-1.
		  Measurements of the cosmic growth rate from the WiggleZ
		  Survey and other current and future observations offer a
		  powerful test of the physical nature of dark energy that is
		  complementary to distance-redshift measures such as
		  supernovae and baryon acoustic oscillations.},

	Abstract = {We measure the imprint of baryon acoustic oscillations
		  (BAOs) in the galaxy clustering pattern at the highest
		  redshift achieved to date, z= 0.6, using the distribution
		  of N= 132 509 emission-line galaxies in the WiggleZ Dark
		  Energy Survey. We quantify BAOs using three statistics: the
		  galaxy correlation function, power spectrum and the
		  band-filtered estimator introduced by Xu et al. The results
		  are mutually consistent, corresponding to a 4.0 per cent
		  measurement of the cosmic distance-redshift relation at z=
		  0.6 [in terms of the acoustic parameter 'A(z)' introduced
		  by Eisenstein et al., we find A(z= 0.6) = 0.452 $\pm$
		  0.018]. Both BAOs and power spectrum shape information
		  contribute towards these constraints. The statistical
		  significance of the detection of the acoustic peak in the
		  correlation function, relative to a wiggle-free model, is
		  3.2sigma. The ratios of our distance measurements to those
		  obtained using BAOs in the distribution of luminous red
		  galaxies at redshifts z= 0.2 and 0.35 are consistent with a
		  flat Lambda cold dark matter model that also provides a
		  good fit to the pattern of observed fluctuations in the
		  cosmic microwave background radiation. The addition of the
		  current WiggleZ data results in a ???30 per cent
		  improvement in the measurement accuracy of a constant
		  equation of state, w, using BAO data alone. Based solely on
		  geometric BAO distance ratios, accelerating expansion (w <
		  -1/3) is required with a probability of 99.8 per cent,
		  providing a consistency check of conclusions based on
		  supernovae observations. Further improvements in
		  cosmological constraints will result when the WiggleZ
		  survey data set is complete.},

	Abstract = {Astronomical observations suggest that today's Universe is
		  dominated by a dark energy of unknown physical origin. One
		  of the most notable results obtained from many models is
		  that dark energy should cause the expansion of the Universe
		  to accelerate: but the expansion rate as a function of time
		  has proved very difficult to measure directly. We present a
		  new determination of the cosmic expansion history by
		  combining distant supernovae observations with a
		  geometrical analysis of large-scale galaxy clustering
		  within the WiggleZ Dark Energy Survey, using the
		  Alcock-Paczynski test to measure the distortion of standard
		  spheres. Our result constitutes a robust and non-parametric
		  measurement of the Hubble expansion rate as a function of
		  time, which we measure with 10-15 per cent precision in
		  four bins within the redshift range 0.1 < z < 0.9. We
		  demonstrate, in a manner insensitive to the assumed
		  cosmological model, that the cosmic expansion is
		  accelerating. Furthermore, we find that this expansion
		  history is consistent with a cosmological-constant dark
		  energy.},

	Abstract = {We discuss the convergence of cosmological perturbation
		  theory. We prove that the polynomial enhancement of the
		  non-linear corrections expected from the effects of soft
		  modes is absent in equal-time correlators like the power or
		  bispectrum. We first show this at leading order by
		  resumming the most important corrections of soft modes to
		  an arbitrary skeleton of hard fluctuations. We derive the
		  same result in the eikonal approximation, which also allows
		  us to show the absence of enhancement at any order. We
		  complement the proof by an explicit calculation of the
		  power spectrum at two-loop order, and by further numerical
		  checks at higher orders. Using these insights, we argue
		  that the modification of the power spectrum from soft modes
		  corresponds at most to logarithmic corrections at any order
		  in perturbation theory. Finally, we discuss the asymptotic
		  behavior in the large and small momentum regimes and
		  identify the expansion parameter pertinent to non-linear
		  corrections.},

        Our formulation involves a non-perturbative resummation of
        Lagrangian perturbation theory and indeed can be viewed as a
        partial resummation of the formalism of Matsubara in which we
        keep exponentiated all of the terms which tend to a constant at
        large separation. One of the key features of our method is that
        we naturally recover the Zel'dovich approximation as the lowest
        order of our expansion for the matter correlation function. We
        compare our results against a suite of N-body simulations and
        obtain good agreement for the correlation functions in real
        space and for the monopole correlation function in redshift
        space. The agreement becomes worse for higher multipole moments
        of the redshift-space, halo correlation function. Our formalism
        naturally includes non-linear bias and explains the strong bias-
        dependence of the multipole moments of the redshift-space
        correlation function seen in N-body simulations.}",

@article{chan12,
	Abstract = {The relationship between galaxy and matter overdensities,
		  bias, is most often assumed to be local. This is however
		  unstable under time evolution, we provide proofs under
		  several sets of assumptions. In the simplest model galaxies
		  are created locally and linearly biased at a single time,
		  and subsequently move with the matter (no velocity bias)
		  conserving their comoving number density (no merging). We
		  show that, after this formation time, the bias becomes
		  unavoidably non-ocal and non-inear at large scales. We
		  identify the non-ocal gravitationally induced fields in
		  which the galaxy overdensity can be expanded, showing that
		  they can be constructed out of the invariants of the
		  deformation tensor (Galileons). In addition, we show that
		  this result persists if we include an arbitrary evolution
		  of the comoving number density of tracers. We then include
		  velocity bias, and show that new contributions appear, a
		  dipole field being the signature at second order. We test
		  these predictions by studying the dependence of halo
		  overdensities in cells of fixed matter density:
		  measurements in simulations show that departures from the
		  mean bias relation are strongly correlated with the
		  non-ocal gravitationally induced fields identified by our
		  formalism. The effects on non-ocal bias seen in the
		  simulations are most important for the most biased halos,
		  as expected from our predictions. The non-ocality seen in
		  the simulations is not fully captured by assuming local
		  bias in Lagrangian space. Accounting for these effects when
		  modeling galaxy bias is essential for correctly describing
		  the dependence on triangle shape of the galaxy bispectrum,
		  and hence constraining cosmological parameters and
		  primordial non-aussianity. We show that using our formalism
		  we remove an important systematic in the determination of
		  bias parameters from the galaxy bispectrum, particularly
		  for luminous galaxies. (abridged)},

	Abstract = {Galaxy clustering data can be used to measure the cosmic
		  expansion history H(z), the angular diameter distance DA(z)
		  and the linear redshift-space distortion parameter beta(z).
		  Here we present a method for using effective multipoles of
		  the galaxy two-point correlation function (hat{xi }_0(s),
		  hat{xi }_2(s), hat{xi }_4(s) and hat{xi }_6(s), with s
		  denoting the comoving separation) to measure H(z), DA(z)
		  and beta(z), and validate it using LasDamas mock galaxy
		  catalogues. Our definition of effective multipoles
		  explicitly incorporates the discreteness of measurements,
		  and treats the measured correlation function and its
		  theoretical model on the same footing. We find that for the
		  mock data, hat{xi }_0+hat{xi }_2+hat{xi }_4 captures nearly
		  all the information, and gives significantly stronger
		  constraints on H(z), DA(z) and beta(z), compared to using

		  scales of s < 60 Mpc h-1 from the measurement from mock
		  data [in contrast to hat{xi }_0(s), hat{xi }_2(s) and
		  hat{xi }_6(s)]; thus, we only use hat{xi }_0+hat{xi }_2 for

	Abstract = {Poisson distributed shot noise is normally considered in
		  the Gaussian limit in cosmology. However, if the shot noise
		  is large enough and the correlation function/power spectrum
		  conspires, the Gaussian approximation mis-estimates the
		  errors and their covariance significantly. The power
		  spectrum, even for initially Gaussian densities, acquires
		  cross correlations which can be large, while the change in
		  the correlation function error matrix is diagonal except at
		  zero separation. Two- and three-dimensional power law
		  correlation function and power spectrum examples are given.
		  These corrections appear to have a large effect when
		  applied to galaxy clusters, e.g., for SZ selected galaxy
		  clusters in two dimensions. This can increase the error
		  estimates for cosmological parameter estimation and
		  consequently affect survey strategies, as the corrections
		  are minimized for surveys which are deep and narrow rather
		  than wide and shallow. In addition, a rewriting of the
		  error matrix for the power spectrum/correlation function is
		  given which eliminates most of the Bessel function
		  dependence (in two dimensions) and all of it (in three
		  dimensions), which makes the calculation of the error
		  matrix more tractable. This applies even when the shot

	Abstract = {We present a power-spectrum analysis of the final 2dF
		  Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS), employing a direct Fourier
		  method. The sample used comprises 221414 galaxies with
		  measured redshifts. We investigate in detail the modelling
		  of the sample selection, improving on previous treatments
		  in a number of respects. A new angular mask is derived,
		  based on revisions to the photometric calibration. The
		  redshift selection function is determined by dividing the
		  survey according to rest-frame colour, and deducing a
		  self-consistent treatment of k-corrections and evolution
		  for each population. The covariance matrix for the
		  power-spectrum estimates is determined using two different
		  approaches to the construction of mock surveys, which are
		  used to demonstrate that the input cosmological model can
		  be correctly recovered. We discuss in detail the possible
		  differences between the galaxy and mass power spectra, and
		  treat these using simulations, analytic models and a hybrid
		  empirical approach. Based on these investigations, we are
		  confident that the 2dFGRS power spectrum can be used to
		  infer the matter content of the universe. On large scales,
		  our estimated power spectrum shows evidence for the `baryon
		  oscillations' that are predicted in cold dark matter (CDM)
		  models. Fitting to a CDM model, assuming a primordial ns= 1
		  spectrum, h= 0.72 and negligible neutrino mass, the
		  preferred parameters are Omegamh= 0.168 +/- 0.016 and a
		  baryon fraction Omegab/Omegam= 0.185 +/- 0.046 (1sigma
		  errors). The value of Omegamh is 1sigma lower than the 0.20
		  +/- 0.03 in our 2001 analysis of the partially complete
		  2dFGRS. This shift is largely due to the signal from the
		  newly sampled regions of space, rather than the refinements
		  in the treatment of observational selection. This analysis
		  therefore implies a density significantly below the
		  standard Omegam= 0.3: in combination with cosmic microwave
		  background (CMB) data from the Wilkinson Microwave
		  Anisotropy Probe (WMAP), we infer Omegam= 0.231 +/-
		  0.021.},

	Abstract = {We employ high-resolution dissipationless simulations of
		  the concordance LambdaCDM cosmology
		  (Omega0=1-OmegaLambda=0.3, h=0.7, sigma8=0.9) to model the
		  observed luminosity dependence and evolution of galaxy
		  clustering through most of the age of the universe, from
		  z~5 to z~0. We use a simple, nonparametric model, which
		  monotonically relates galaxy luminosities to the maximum
		  circular velocity of dark matter halos (Vmax) by preserving
		  the observed galaxy luminosity function in order to match
		  the halos in simulations with observed galaxies. The novel
		  feature of the model is the use of the maximum circular
		  velocity at the time of accretion, Vaccmax, for subhalos,
		  the halos located within virial regions of larger halos. We
		  argue that for subhalos in dissipationless simulations,
		  Vaccmax reflects the luminosity and stellar mass of the
		  associated galaxies better than the circular velocity at
		  the epoch of observation, Vnowmax. The simulations and our
		  model L-Vmax relation predict the shape, amplitude, and
		  luminosity dependence of the two-point correlation function
		  in excellent agreement with the observed galaxy clustering
		  in the SDSS data at z~0 and in the DEEP2 samples at z~1
		  over the entire probed range of projected separations,
		  0.1<rp/(h-1 Mpc)<10.0. In particular, the small-scale
		  upturn of the correlation function from the power-law form
		  in the SDSS and DEEP2 luminosity-selected samples is
		  reproduced very well. At z~3-5, our predictions also match
		  the observed shape and amplitude of the angular two-point
		  correlation function of Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) on both
		  large and small scales, including the small-scale upturn.
		  This suggests that, like galaxies in lower redshift
		  samples, the LBGs are fair tracers of the overall halo
		  population and that their luminosity is tightly correlated
		  with the circular velocity (and hence mass) of their dark
		  matter halos.},

		  and LambdaCDM): relations between an n-point function of
		  the density contrast delta and an (n+1)-point function in
		  the limit in which one of the (n+1) momenta becomes much
		  smaller than the others. These are based on the observation
		  that a long mode, in single-field models of inflation,
		  reduces to a diffeomorphism since its freezing during
		  inflation all the way until the late universe, even when
		  the long mode is inside the horizon (but out of the sound
		  horizon). These results are derived in Newtonian gauge, at
		  first and second order in the small momentum q of the long
		  mode and they are valid non-perturbatively in the
		  short-scale delta. In the non-relativistic limit our
		  results match with [1]. These relations are a consequence
		  of diffeomorphism invariance; they are not satisfied in the
		  presence of extra degrees of freedom during inflation or
		  violation of the Equivalence Principle (extra forces) in

	Abstract = {We study the nonlinear propagator, a key ingredient in
		  renormalized perturbation theory (RPT) that allows a
		  well-controlled extension of perturbation theory into the
		  nonlinear regime. We show that it can be thought as
		  measuring the memory of density and velocity fields to
		  their initial conditions. This provides a clean definition
		  of the validity of linear theory, which is shown to be much
		  more restricted than usually recognized in the literature.
		  We calculate the nonlinear propagator in RPT and compare to
		  measurements in numerical simulations, showing remarkable
		  agreement well into the nonlinear regime. We also show that
		  N-body simulations require a rather large volume to recover
		  the correct propagator, due to the missing large-scale
		  modes. Our results for the nonlinear propagator provide an
		  essential element to compute the nonlinear power spectrum
		  in RPT.},

		  if galaxies trace the mass distribution, and that models
		  with omega of roughly two, while better, still do not
		  provide a fully acceptable match with observation. Finally,
		  a situation in which galaxy formation is suppressed except
		  in sufficiently dense regions is modelled which leads to
		  models which can agree with observation quite well even for

	Abstract = {We propose a general formalism for galaxy biasing and
		  apply it to methods for measuring cosmological parameters,
		  such as regression of light versus mass, the analysis of
		  redshift distortions, measures involving skewness, and the
		  cosmic virial theorem. The common linear and deterministic
		  relation g=bdelta between the density fluctuation fields of
		  galaxies g and mass delta is replaced by the conditional
		  distribution P(g|delta) of these random fields, smoothed at
		  a given scale at a given time. The nonlinearity is
		  characterized by the conditional mean
		  <g|delta>=b(delta)delta, while the local scatter is
		  represented by the conditional variance sigma^2_b(delta)
		  and higher moments. The scatter arises from hidden factors
		  affecting galaxy formation and from shot noise unless it
		  has been properly removed. For applications involving
		  second-order local moments, the biasing is defined by three
		  natural parameters: the slope b of the regression of g on
		  delta, a nonlinearity b, and a scatter sigma_b. The ratio
		  of variances b^2_var and the correlation coefficient r mix
		  these parameters. The nonlinearity and the scatter lead to
		  underestimates of order b^2/b^2 and sigma^2_b/b^2 in the
		  different estimators of beta (~Omega^0.6/b). The nonlinear
		  effects are typically smaller. Local stochasticity affects
		  the redshift-distortion analysis only by limiting the
		  useful range of scales, especially for power spectra. In
		  this range, for linear stochastic biasing, the analysis
		  reduces to Kaiser's formula for b (not b_var), independent
		  of the scatter. The distortion analysis is affected by
		  nonlinear properties of biasing but in a weak way.
		  Estimates of the nontrivial features of the biasing scheme
		  are made based on simulations and toy models, and
		  strategies for measuring them are discussed. They may
		  partly explain the range of estimates for beta.},

	Abstract = {We calculate the redshift space correlation function and
		  the power spectrum of density peaks of a Gaussian random
		  field. In the linear regime k 0.1 h/Mpc, the redshift space
		  power spectrum is P^s_{pk}(k,u) = exp(-^2 s_{vel}^2 k^2
		  u^2) * [b_{pk}(k) + b_{vel}(k) f u^2]^2 * P_m(k), where u
		  is the angle with respect to the line of sight, s_{vel} is
		  the one-imensional velocity dispersion, f is the growth
		  rate, and b_{pk}(k) and b_{vel}(k) are k-ependent linear
		  spatial and velocity bias factors. For peaks, the value of
		  s_{vel} depends upon the functional form of b_{vel}. The
		  peaks model is remarkable because it has unbiased
		  velocities - peak motions are driven by dark matter flows -
		  but, in order to achieve this, b_{vel} is k-ependent. We
		  speculate that this is true in general: k-ependence of the
		  spatial bias will lead to k-ependence of b_{vel} even if
		  the biased tracers flow with the dark matter. Because of
		  the k-ependence of the linear bias parameters, standard
		  manipulations applied to the peak model will lead to
		  k-ependent estimates of the growth factor that could
		  erroneously be interpreted as a signature of modified dark
		  energy or gravity. We use the Fisher formalism to show that
		  the constraint on the growth rate f is degraded by a factor
		  of two if one allows for a k-ependent velocity bias of the
		  peak type. We discuss a simple estimate of nonlinear
		  evolution and illustrate the effect of the peak bias on the
		  redshift space multipoles. For k 0.1 h/Mpc, the peak bias
		  is deterministic but k-ependent, so the configuration space
		  bias is stochastic and scale dependent, both in real and
		  redshift space. We provide expressions for this
		  stochasticity and its evolution (abridged).},

	Abstract = {Models of galaxy and halo clustering commonly assume that
		  the tracers can be treated as a continuous field locally
		  biased with respect to the underlying mass distribution. In
		  the peak model pioneered by Bardeen et al. [Astrophys. J.
		  304, 15 (1986)ASJOAB0004-637X10.1086/164143], one considers
		  instead density maxima of the initial, Gaussian mass
		  density field as an approximation to the formation site of
		  virialized objects. In this paper, the peak model is
		  extended in two ways to improve its predictive accuracy.
		  First, we derive the two-point correlation function of
		  initial density peaks up to second order and demonstrate
		  that a peak-background split approach can be applied to
		  obtain the k-independent and k-dependent peak bias factors
		  at all orders. Second, we explore the gravitational
		  evolution of the peak correlation function within the
		  Zel'dovich approximation. We show that the local
		  (Lagrangian) bias approach emerges as a special case of the
		  peak model, in which all bias parameters are scale
		  independent and there is no statistical velocity bias. We
		  apply our formulas to study how the Lagrangian peak
		  biasing, the diffusion due to large scale flows, and the
		  mode coupling due to nonlocal interactions affect the scale
		  dependence of bias from small separations up to the baryon
		  acoustic oscillation (BAO) scale. For 2sigma density peaks
		  collapsing at z=0.3, our model predicts a ??5% residual
		  scale-dependent bias around the acoustic scale that arises
		  mostly from first order Lagrangian peak biasing (as opposed
		  to second order gravity mode coupling). We also search for
		  a scale dependence of bias in the large scale
		  autocorrelation of massive halos extracted from a very
		  large N-body simulation provided by the MICE Collaboration.
		  For halos with mass M???1014M&sun;/h, our measurements
		  demonstrate a scale-dependent bias across the BAO feature
		  which is very well reproduced by a prediction based on the
		  peak model.},

	Abstract = {Maxima of the linear density field form a point process
		  that can be used to understand the spatial distribution of
		  virialized halos that collapsed from initially overdense
		  regions. However, owing to the peak constraint, clustering
		  statistics of discrete density peaks are difficult to
		  evaluate. For this reason, local bias schemes have received
		  considerably more attention in the literature thus far. In
		  this paper, we show that the two-point correlation function
		  of maxima of a homogeneous and isotropic Gaussian random
		  field can be thought of, up to second order at least, as
		  arising from a local bias expansion formulated in terms of
		  rotationally invariant variables. This expansion relies on
		  a unique smoothing scale, which is the Lagrangian radius of
		  dark matter halos. The great advantage of this local bias
		  approach is that it circumvents the difficult computation
		  of joint probability distributions. We demonstrate that the
		  bias factors associated with these rotational invariants
		  can be computed using a peak-background split argument, in
		  which the background perturbation shifts the corresponding
		  probability distribution functions. Consequently, the bias
		  factors are orthogonal polynomials averaged over those
		  spatial locations that satisfy the peak constraint. In
		  particular, asphericity in the peak profile contributes to
		  the clustering at quadratic and higher order, with bias
		  factors given by generalized Laguerre polynomials. We
		  speculate that our approach remains valid at all orders,
		  and that it can be extended to describe clustering
		  statistics of any point process of a Gaussian random field.
		  Our results will be very useful to model the clustering of
		  discrete tracers with more realistic collapse prescriptions
		  involving the tidal shear for instance.},

	Abstract = {We discuss the effects of nonlinear structure formation on
		  the signature of acoustic oscillations in the late-time
		  galaxy distribution. We argue that the dominant nonlinear
		  effect is the differential motion of pairs of tracers
		  separated by 150 Mpc. These motions are driven by bulk
		  flows and cluster formation and are much smaller than the
		  acoustic scale itself. We present a model for the nonlinear
		  evolution based on the distribution of pairwise Lagrangian
		  displacements that provides a quantitative model for the
		  degradation of the acoustic signature, even for biased
		  tracers in redshift space. The Lagrangian displacement
		  distribution can be calibrated with a significantly smaller
		  set of simulations than would be needed to construct a
		  precise power spectrum. By connecting the acoustic
		  signature in the Fourier basis with that in the
		  configuration basis, we show that the acoustic signature is
		  more robust than the usual Fourier-space intuition would
		  suggest, because the beat frequency between the peaks and
		  troughs of the acoustic oscillations is a very small
		  wavenumber that is well inside the linear regime. We argue
		  that any possible shift of the acoustic scale is related to
		  infall on a scale of 150 Mpc, which is O(0.5%) fractionally
		  at first order, even at z=0. For the matter, there is a
		  first-order cancellation such that the mean shift is
		  O(10-4). However, galaxy bias can circumvent this
		  cancellation and produce a subpercent systematic bias.},

	Abstract = {Based on the Millennium Simulation we examine assembly
		  bias for the halo properties: shape, triaxiality,
		  concentration, spin, shape of the velocity ellipsoid, and
		  velocity anisotropy. For consistency, we determine all
		  these properties using the same set of particles, namely
		  all gravitationally self-bound particles belonging to the
		  most massive substructure of a given friends-of-friends
		  halo. We confirm that near-spherical and high-spin halos
		  show enhanced clustering. The opposite is true for strongly
		  aspherical and low-spin halos. Further, below the typical
		  collapse mass, M *, more concentrated halos show stronger
		  clustering, whereas less concentrated halos are less
		  clustered which is reversed for masses above M *. Going
		  beyond earlier work we show that: (1) oblate halos are more
		  strongly clustered than prolate ones; (2) the dependence of
		  clustering on the shape of the velocity ellipsoid coincides
		  with that of the real-space shape, although the signal is
		  stronger; (3) halos with weak velocity anisotropy are more
		  clustered, whereas radially anisotropic halos are more
		  weakly clustered; (4) for all highly clustered subsets we
		  find systematically less radially biased velocity
		  anisotropy profiles. These findings indicate that the
		  velocity structure of halos is tightly correlated with
		  environment.},

		  formation of an arbitrary, effectively local biasing
		  transformation of a hierarchical underlying matter
		  distribution. We show that a general form of such a
		  transformation preserves the hierarchical properties and
		  the shape of the dispersion in the limit of small
		  fluctuations, i.e., on large scales, although the values of
		  the hierarchical amplitudes may change arbitrarily. We
		  present expressions for the induced hierarchical amplitudes
		  S(g,j) of the galaxy distribution in terms of the matter
		  amplitudes S(j) and biasing parameters for j = 3-7. For
		  higher order correlations, j greater than 2, restricting to
		  a linear bias is not a consistent approximation even at
		  very large scales. To draw any conclusions from the galaxy
		  distribution about matter correlations of order j,
		  properties of biasing must be specified completely to order
		  j - 1.},

	Abstract = {We use a very large simulation of the concordance Lambda
		  cold dark matter cosmogony to study the clustering of dark
		  matter haloes. For haloes less massive than about
		  1013h-1Msolar the amplitude of the two-point correlation
		  function on large scales depends strongly on halo formation
		  time. Haloes that assembled at high redshift are
		  substantially more clustered than those that assembled more
		  recently. The effect is a smooth function of halo formation
		  time and its amplitude increases with decreasing halo mass.
		  At 1011h-1Msolar the `oldest' 10 per cent of haloes are
		  more than five times more strongly correlated than the
		  `youngest' 10 per cent. This unexpected result is
		  incompatible with the standard excursion set theory for
		  structure growth, and it contradicts a fundamental
		  assumption of the halo occupation distribution models often
		  used to study galaxy clustering, namely that the galaxy
		  content of a halo of given mass is statistically
		  independent of its larger scale environment.},

@article{guo12,
	Abstract = {In fiber-fed galaxy redshift surveys, the finite size of
		  the fiber plugs prevents two fibers from being placed too
		  close to one another, limiting the ability to study galaxy
		  clustering on all scales. We present a new method for
		  correcting such fiber collision effects in galaxy
		  clustering statistics based on spectroscopic observations.
		  The target galaxy sample is divided into two distinct
		  populations according to the targeting algorithm of fiber
		  placement, one free of fiber collisions and the other
		  consisting of collided galaxies. The clustering statistics
		  are a combination of the contributions from these two
		  populations. Our method makes use of observations in tile
		  overlap regions to measure the contributions from the
		  collided population, and to therefore recover the full
		  clustering statistics. The method is rooted in solid
		  theoretical ground and is tested extensively on mock galaxy
		  catalogs. We demonstrate that our method can well recover
		  the projected and the full three-dimensional (3D)
		  redshift-space two-point correlation functions (2PCFs) on
		  scales both below and above the fiber collision scale,
		  superior to the commonly used nearest neighbor and angular
		  correction methods. We discuss potential systematic effects
		  in our method. The statistical correction accuracy of our
		  method is only limited by sample variance, which scales
		  down with (the square root of) the volume probed. For a
		  sample similar to the final SDSS-III BOSS galaxy sample,
		  the statistical correction error is expected to be at the
		  level of 1% on scales ~0.1-30 h -1 Mpc for the 2PCFs. The
		  systematic error only occurs on small scales, caused by
		  imperfect correction of collision multiplets, and its
		  magnitude is expected to be smaller than 5%. Our correction
		  method, which can be generalized to other clustering
		  statistics as well, enables more accurate measurements of
		  full 3D galaxy clustering on all scales with galaxy
		  redshift surveys.},

	Abstract = {Using the technique of Angulo & White, we scale the
		  Millennium and Millennium II simulations of structure
		  growth in a Lambda cold dark matter (LambdaCDM) universe
		  from the cosmological parameters with which they were
		  carried out (based on first-year results from the Wilkinson
		  Microwave Anisotropy Probe, WMAP1) to parameters consistent
		  with the seven-year WMAP data (WMAP7). We implement
		  semi-analytic galaxy formation modelling (SAM) on both
		  simulations in both cosmologies to investigate how the
		  formation, evolution and clustering of galaxies are
		  predicted to vary with cosmological parameters. The
		  increased matter density Omegam and decreased linear
		  fluctuation amplitude sigma8 in WMAP7 have compensating
		  effects, so that the abundance and clustering of dark
		  haloes are predicted to be very similar to those in WMAP1
		  for z <= 3. As a result, local galaxy properties can be
		  reproduced equally well in the two cosmologies by slightly
		  altering galaxy formation parameters. The evolution of the
		  galaxy populations is then also similar. In WMAP7,
		  structure forms slightly later. This shifts the peak in
		  cosmic star formation rate to lower redshift, resulting in
		  slightly bluer galaxies at z = 0. Nevertheless, the model
		  still predicts more passive low-mass galaxies than are
		  observed. For rp < 1 Mpc, the z = 0 clustering of low-mass
		  galaxies is weaker for WMAP7 than for WMAP1 and closer to
		  that observed, but the two cosmologies give very similar
		  results for more massive galaxies and on large scales. At z
		  > 1 galaxies are predicted to be more strongly clustered
		  for WMAP7. Differences in galaxy properties, including
		  clustering, in these two cosmologies are rather small out
		  to z ?? 3. Given that there are still considerable residual
		  uncertainties in galaxy formation models, it is very
		  difficult to distinguish WMAP1 from WMAP7 through
		  observations of galaxy properties or their evolution.},

@article{guzzo08,
	Abstract = {Observations of distant supernovae indicate that the
		  Universe is now in a phase of accelerated expansion the
		  physical cause of which is a mystery. Formally, this
		  requires the inclusion of a term acting as a negative
		  pressure in the equations of cosmic expansion, accounting
		  for about 75 per cent of the total energy density in the
		  Universe. The simplest option for this `dark energy'
		  corresponds to a `cosmological constant', perhaps related
		  to the quantum vacuum energy. Physically viable
		  alternatives invoke either the presence of a scalar field
		  with an evolving equation of state, or extensions of
		  general relativity involving higher-order curvature terms
		  or extra dimensions. Although they produce similar
		  expansion rates, different models predict measurable
		  differences in the growth rate of large-scale structure
		  with cosmic time. A fingerprint of this growth is provided
		  by coherent galaxy motions, which introduce a radial
		  anisotropy in the clustering pattern reconstructed by
		  galaxy redshift surveys. Here we report a measurement of
		  this effect at a redshift of 0.8. Using a new survey of
		  more than 10,000 faint galaxies, we measure the anisotropy
		  parameter beta = 0.70+/-0.26, which corresponds to a growth
		  rate of structure at that time of f = 0.91+/-0.36. This is
		  consistent with the standard cosmological-constant model
		  with low matter density and flat geometry, although the
		  error bars are still too large to distinguish among
		  alternative origins for the accelerated expansion. The
		  correct origin could be determined with a further
		  factor-of-ten increase in the sampled volume at similar
		  redshift.},

	Abstract = {We present a detailed analysis of the two-point
		  correlation function, xi(sigma, pi), from the 2dF Galaxy
		  Redshift Survey (2dFGRS). The large size of the catalogue,
		  which contains ~220000 redshifts, allows us to make
		  high-precision measurements of various properties of the
		  galaxy clustering pattern. The effective redshift at which
		  our estimates are made is zs~ 0.15, and similarly the
		  effective luminosity, Ls~ 1.4L*. We estimate the
		  redshift-space correlation function, xi(s), from which we
		  measure the redshift-space clustering length, s0= 6.82 +/-
		  0.28 h-1 Mpc. We also estimate the projected correlation
		  function, Xi(sigma), and the real-space correlation
		  function, xi(r), which can be fit by a power law
		  (r/r0)-gammar, with r0= 5.05 +/- 0.26 h-1 Mpc, gammar= 1.67
		  +/- 0.03. For r>~ 20 h-1 Mpc, xi drops below a power law
		  as, for instance, is expected in the popular Lambda cold
		  dark matter model. The ratio of amplitudes of the real- and
		  redshift-space correlation functions on scales of 8-30 h-1
		  Mpc gives an estimate of the redshift-space distortion
		  parameter beta. The quadrupole moment of xi(sigma, pi) on
		  scales 30-40 h-1 Mpc provides another estimate of beta. We
		  also estimate the distribution function of pairwise
		  peculiar velocities, f(v), including rigorously the
		  significant effect due to the infall velocities, and we
		  find that the distribution is well fit by an exponential
		  form. The accuracy of our xi(sigma, pi) measurement is
		  sufficient to constrain a model, which simultaneously fits
		  the shape and amplitude of xi(r) and the two redshift-space
		  distortion effects parametrized by beta and velocity
		  dispersion, a. We find beta= 0.49 +/- 0.09 and a= 506 +/-
		  52 km s-1, although the best-fitting values are strongly
		  correlated. We measure the variation of the peculiar
		  velocity dispersion with projected separation, a(sigma),
		  and find that the shape is consistent with models and
		  simulations. This is the first time that beta and f(v) have
		  been estimated from a self-consistent model of galaxy
		  velocities. Using the constraints on bias from recent
		  estimates, and taking account of redshift evolution, we
		  conclude that beta (L=L*, z= 0) = 0.47 +/- 0.08, and that
		  the present-day matter density of the Universe, Omegam~
		  0.3, consistent with other 2dFGRS estimates and independent
		  analyses.},

	Abstract = {Complimenting recent work on the effective field theory of
		  cosmological large scale structures, here we present
		  detailed approximate analytical results and further
		  pedagogical understanding of the method. We start from the
		  collisionless Boltzmann equation and integrate out short
		  modes of a dark matter/dark energy dominated universe
		  (LambdaCDM) whose matter is comprised of massive particles
		  as used in cosmological simulations. This establishes a
		  long distance effective fluid, valid for length scales
		  larger than the nonlinear scale ??10 Mpc, and provides the
		  complete description of large scale structure formation.
		  Extracting the time dependence, we derive recursion
		  relations that encode the perturbative solution. This is
		  exact for the matter dominated era and quite accurate in
		  LambdaCDM also. The effective fluid is characterized by
		  physical parameters, including sound speed and viscosity.
		  These two fluid parameters play a degenerate role with each
		  other and lead to a relative correction from standard
		  perturbation theory of the form ??10-6c2k2/H2. Starting
		  from the linear theory, we calculate corrections to
		  cosmological observables, such as the
		  baryon-acoustic-oscillation peak, which we compute
		  semianalytically at one-loop order. Due to the nonzero
		  fluid parameters, the predictions of the effective field
		  theory agree with observation much more accurately than
		  standard perturbation theory and we explain why. We also
		  discuss corrections from treating dark matter as
		  interacting or wavelike and other issues.},

	Abstract = {Non-linear redshift-space distortions, the Finger-of-God
		  (FoG) effect, can complicate the interpretation of the
		  galaxy power spectrum. Here, we demonstrate the method
		  proposed by Hikage, Takada & Spergel to use complimentary
		  observations to directly constrain this effect on the data.
		  We use catalogues of Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs) and
		  photometric galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
		  (SDSS) Data Release 7 (DR7) to measure the redshift-space
		  power spectrum of LRGs, the cross-correlation of LRGs with
		  the shapes of background photometric galaxies
		  (galaxy-galaxy weak lensing) and the projected
		  cross-correlation of LRGs with photometric galaxies having
		  similar photometric redshifts to the LRG spectroscopic
		  redshift. All of these measurements use a reconstructed
		  halo field. While we use the position of each LRG for
		  single LRG systems, we compare the measurements using
		  different halo-centre proxies for multiple-LRG systems (4.5
		  per cent of all the haloes): the brightest LRG position
		  (BLRG), the faintest LRG position (FLRG) and their
		  arithmetical mean position (Mean), respectively, in each
		  system. We find significant differences in the measured
		  correlations of different centres, showing consistent
		  off-centring effects in the three observables. By comparing
		  the measurements with a halo model that treats the
		  satellite photometric galaxies as being distributed
		  according to a generalized Navarro, Frenk and White
		  profile, we find that ??40 (70) per cent of BLRGs (FLRGs)
		  are off-centred satellite galaxies in the multiple-LRG
		  systems. The satellite LRGs have typical off-centring
		  radius of ??400 kpc h-1, and velocity dispersion of about
		  500 km s-1 in host haloes with a mean mass of 1.6 ?? 1014
		  M&sun; h-1. We show that, if LRGs in the single LRG systems
		  have similar offsets, the residual FoG contamination in the
		  LRG power spectrum can be significant at k ??? 0.1 h Mpc-1,
		  which may cause a bias in cosmological parameters
		  determined by the shape of the power spectrum, such as the
		  neutrino mass. Our results demonstrate that overlapping
		  spectroscopic and imaging galaxy surveys can be used to
		  observationally calibrate the FoG contamination and more
		  robustly use the galaxy power spectrum for cosmological
		  measurements.},

	Abstract = {We study the impacts of the satellite galaxies on the
		  redshift-space distortions. In our multipole power spectrum
		  analysis of the luminous red galaxies (LRGs) samples of the
		  Sloan digital sky survey (SDSS), we have clearly detected
		  the non-zero signature of the hexadecapole and
		  tetrahexadecapole spectrum, which almost disappears in the
		  power spectrum with the sample of the brightest LRGs only.
		  We thus demonstrate that the satellite LRGs in multiple

		  power spectrum though its fraction is small. The behavior
		  can be understood by a simple halo model, in which the
		  one-halo term, describing the Finger of God (FoG) effect
		  from the satellite galaxies, makes the dominant
		  contribution to the higher multipole spectra. We
		  demonstrate that the small-scale information of higher
		  multipole spectrum is useful for calibrating the satellite
		  FoG effect and improves the measurement of the cosmic
		  growth rate dramatically. We further demonstrate that the
		  fiber collision in the galaxy survey influences the
		  one-halo term and the higher multipole spectra, because the
		  number of satellite galaxies in the halo occupation
		  distribution (HOD) is changed. We also discuss about the
		  impact of satellite galaxies on future high-redshift

	Abstract = {We present cosmological parameter constraints based on the
		  final nine-year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP)
		  data, in conjunction with a number of additional
		  cosmological data sets. The WMAP data alone, and in
		  combination, continue to be remarkably well fit by a
		  six-parameter LambdaCDM model. When WMAP data are combined
		  with measurements of the high-l cosmic microwave background
		  anisotropy, the baryon acoustic oscillation scale, and the
		  Hubble constant, the matter and energy densities, Omega b h
		  2, Omega c h 2, and OmegaLambda, are each determined to a
		  precision of ~1.5%. The amplitude of the primordial
		  spectrum is measured to within 3%, and there is now
		  evidence for a tilt in the primordial spectrum at the
		  5sigma level, confirming the first detection of tilt based
		  on the five-year WMAP data. At the end of the WMAP mission,
		  the nine-year data decrease the allowable volume of the
		  six-dimensional LambdaCDM parameter space by a factor of
		  68,000 relative to pre-WMAP measurements. We investigate a
		  number of data combinations and show that their LambdaCDM
		  parameter fits are consistent. New limits on deviations
		  from the six-parameter model are presented, for example:
		  the fractional contribution of tensor modes is limited to r
		  < 0.13 (95% CL); the spatial curvature parameter is limited
		  to \Omega _k = -0.0027^{+ 0.0039}_{- 0.0038}; the summed
		  mass of neutrinos is limited to ???m nu < 0.44 eV (95% CL);
		  and the number of relativistic species is found to lie
		  within N eff = 3.84 $\pm$ 0.40, when the full data are
		  analyzed. The joint constraint on N eff and the primordial
		  helium abundance, Y He, agrees with the prediction of
		  standard big bang nucleosynthesis. We compare recent Planck
		  measurements of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect with our
		  seven-year measurements, and show their mutual agreement.
		  Our analysis of the polarization pattern around temperature
		  extrema is updated. This confirms a fundamental prediction
		  of the standard cosmological model and provides a striking
		  illustration of acoustic oscillations and adiabatic initial
		  conditions in the early universe.},

		  clusters at intermediate redshift (0.2 <= z <= 0.6) of mass
		  range from ~1 ?? 1014 M sun to ~8 ?? 1014 M sun. The LRGs
		  are selected based on carefully designed color criteria,
		  and the cluster membership is assessed via photometric
		  redshifts. As clusters and LRGs are both viewed as
		  promising tracer of the underlying dark matter
		  distribution, understanding the distribution of LRGs within
		  clusters is an important issue. Our main findings include
		  (1) the halo occupation distribution (HOD) of LRGs inside
		  our cluster sample is langN(M)rang = k(M/1014 h -1 M sun) a
		  , where a = 0.495 $\pm$ 0.105 and k = 1.455 $\pm$ 0.285

		  = 0.580 $\pm$ 0.130 and k = 0.975 $\pm$ 0.240 assuming a
		  Poisson distribution for N(M). (2) The HOD of LRGs [N(M)]
		  and the satellite distribution of LRGs [N(M) - 1] are both
		  consistent with being Poisson. To be more quantitative, we
		  find Var(N)/langNrang = 1.43 $\pm$ 0.35 and Var(N -

		  Navarro-Frenk-White profile gives a concentration of
		  17.5+7.1 -4.3 (6.0+3.2 -1.9) including (excluding)

	Abstract = {The cosmic microwave background (CMB) has provided a
		  precise template for features in the linear power spectrum:
		  the matter-radiation turnover, sound horizon drop, and
		  acoustic oscillations. In a two-dimensional power spectrum
		  in redshift and angular space, the features appear as
		  distorted rings, and yield simultaneous, purely geometric,
		  measures of the Hubble parameter H(z) and angular diameter
		  distance DA(z) via an absolute version of the
		  Alcock-Paczynski test. Employing a simple Fisher matrix
		  tool, we explore how future surveys can exploit these rings
		  of power for dark energy studies. High-z CMB determinations
		  of H and DA are best complemented at moderate to low
		  redshift (z???0.5) with a population of objects that are at
		  least as abundant as clusters of galaxies. We find that a
		  sample similar to that of the ongoing SDSS luminous red
		  galaxy survey can achieve statistical errors at the ??5%
		  level for DA(z) and H(z) in several redshift bins. This, in
		  turn, implies errors of sigma(w)=0.03 0.05 for a constant
		  dark energy equation of state in a flat universe. Deep
		  galaxy cluster surveys such as the planned South Pole
		  Telescope survey can extend this test out to z??1 or as far
		  as redshift follow-up is available. We find that the
		  expected constraints are at the sigma(w)=0.04 0.08 level,
		  comparable to those of galaxies and complementary in
		  redshift coverage.},

	Abstract = {We study a class of metric-variation f(R) models that
		  accelerates the expansion without a cosmological constant
		  and satisfies both cosmological and solar-system tests in
		  the small-field limit of the parameter space. Solar-system
		  tests alone place only weak bounds on these models, since
		  the additional scalar degree of freedom is locked to the
		  high-curvature general-relativistic prediction across more
		  than 25 orders of magnitude in density, out through the
		  solar corona. This agreement requires that the galactic
		  halo be of sufficient extent to maintain the galaxy at high
		  curvature in the presence of the low-curvature cosmological
		  background. If the galactic halo and local environment in
		  f(R) models do not have substantially deeper potentials
		  than expected in LambdaCDM, then cosmological field
		  amplitudes |fR|???10-6 will cause the galactic interior to
		  evolve to low curvature during the acceleration epoch.
		  Viability of large-deviation models therefore rests on the
		  structure and evolution of the galactic halo, requiring
		  cosmological simulations of f(R) models, and not directly
		  on solar-system tests. Even small deviations that
		  conservatively satisfy both galactic and solar-system
		  constraints can still be tested by future, percent-level
		  measurements of the linear power spectrum, while they
		  remain undetectable to cosmological-distance measures.
		  Although we illustrate these effects in a specific class of
		  models, the requirements on f(R) are phrased in a nearly
		  model-independent manner.},

	Abstract = {Redshift space distortion (RSD) observed in galaxy
		  redshift surveys is a powerful tool to test gravity
		  theories on cosmological scales, but the systematic
		  uncertainties must carefully be examined for future surveys
		  with large statistics. Here we employ various analytic
		  models of RSD and estimate the systematic errors on
		  measurements of the structure growth-rate parameter,
		  f\sigma_8, induced by non-linear effects and the halo bias
		  with respect to the dark matter distribution, by using halo
		  catalogues from 40 realisations of 3.4 \times 10^8 comoving
		  h^{-3}Mpc^3 cosmological N-body simulations. We consider
		  hypothetical redshift surveys at redshifts z=0.5, 1.35 and
		  2, and different minimum halo mass thresholds in the range
		  of 5.0 \times 10^{11} -- 2.0 \times 10^{13} h^{-1} M_\odot.
		  We find that the systematic error of f\sigma_8 is greatly
		  reduced to ~4 per cent level, when a recently proposed
		  analytical formula of RSD that takes into account the
		  higher-order coupling between the density and velocity
		  fields is adopted, with a scale-dependent parametric bias
		  model. Dependence of the systematic error on the halo mass,
		  the redshift, and the maximum wavenumber used in the
		  analysis is discussed. We also find that the
		  Wilson-Hilferty transformation is useful to improve the
		  accuracy of likelihood analysis when only a small number of
		  modes are available in power spectrum measurements.},

	Abstract = {The gravitational evolution of scale-free initial spectra
		  P(k) kn in an Einstein-de Sitter universe is widely
		  believed to be self-similar for -3 < n < 4. However, for -3
		  < n < -1 the existence of self-similar scaling has not been
		  adequately demonstrated. Here we investigate the possible
		  breaking of self-similar scaling due to the nonlinear
		  contributions of long-wave modes. For n < -1 the nonlinear
		  terms in the Fourier space fluid equations contain terms
		  that diverge because of contributions from wavenumber k -->
		  0 (the long-wave limit). To assess the possible dynamical
		  effects of this divergence the limit of long-wave
		  contributions is investigated in detail using two different
		  analytical approaches. Perturbative contributions to the
		  power spectrum are examined. It is shown that for n < -1
		  there are divergent contributions at all orders. However,
		  at every order the leading order divergent terms cancel out
		  exactly. This does not rule out the existence of a weaker
		  but nevertheless divergent net contribution. The second
		  approach consists of a nonperturbative approximation,
		  developed to study the nonlinear effects of long-wave mode
		  coupling. A solution for the phase shift of the Fourier
		  space density is obtained which is divergent for n < -1. A
		  kinematical interpretation of the divergence of the phase
		  shift, related to the translational motion induced by the
		  large-scale bulk velocity, is given. Our analysis indicates
		  that the amplitude of the density is not affected by the
		  divergent terms and should therefore display the standard
		  self-similar scaling. Thus, both analytical approaches lead
		  to the conclusion that the self-similar scaling of
		  physically relevant measures of the growth of density
		  perturbations is preserved.},

	Abstract = {We calculate the nonlinear galaxy power spectrum in real
		  space, including nonlinear distortion of the baryon
		  acoustic oscillations, using the standard third-order
		  perturbation theory (PT). The calculation is based upon the
		  assumption that the number density of galaxies is a local
		  function of the underlying, nonlinear density field. The
		  galaxy bias is allowed to be both nonlinear and stochastic.
		  We show that the PT calculation agrees with the galaxy
		  power spectrum estimated from the Millennium Simulation, in
		  the weakly nonlinear regime (defined by the matter power
		  spectrum) at high redshifts, 1 <= z <= 6. We also show
		  that, once three free parameters characterizing galaxy bias
		  are marginalized over, the PT power spectrum fit to the
		  Millennium Simulation data yields unbiased estimates of the
		  distance scale, D, to within the statistical error. This
		  distance scale corresponds to the angular diameter
		  distance, DA (z), and the expansion rate, H(z), in real
		  galaxy surveys. Our results presented in this paper are
		  still restricted to real space. The future work should
		  include the effects of nonlinear redshift space distortion.
		  Nevertheless, our results indicate that nonlinear galaxy
		  bias in the weakly nonlinear regime at high redshifts is
		  reasonably under control.},

	Abstract = {Because of mass assignment onto grid points in the
		  measurement of the power spectrum using a fast Fourier
		  transform (FFT), the raw power spectrum <|deltaf(k)|2>
		  estimated with the FFT is not the same as the true power
		  spectrum P(k). In this paper we derive a formula that
		  relates <|deltaf(k)|2> to P(k). For a sample of N discrete
		  objects, the formula reads
		  <|deltaf(k)|2>=Sigman[|W(k+2kNn)|2P(k+2kNn)+1/N|W(k+2kNn)|2],
		  where W(k) is the Fourier transform of the mass assignment
		  function W(r), kN is the Nyquist wavenumber, and n is an
		  integer vector. The formula is different from that in some
		  previous works in which the summation over n is neglected.
		  For the nearest grid point, cloud-in-cell, and
		  triangular-shaped cloud assignment functions, we show that
		  the shot-noise term Sigman(1/N)|W(k+2kNn)|2 can be
		  expressed by simple analytical functions. To reconstruct
		  P(k) from the alias sum Sigman|W(k+2kNn)|2P(k+2kNn), we
		  propose an iterative method. We test the method by applying
		  it to an N-body simulation sample and show that the method
		  can successfully recover P(k). The discussion is further
		  generalized to samples with observational selection
		  effects.},

	Abstract = {Future weak-lensing measurements of cosmic shear will
		  reach such high accuracy that second-order effects in
		  weak-lensing modeling, such as the influence of baryons on
		  structure formation, become important. We use a controlled
		  set of high-resolution cosmological simulations to quantify
		  this effect by comparing pure N-body dark matter runs with
		  corresponding hydrodynamic simulations, carried out both in
		  nonradiative form and in dissipative form with cooling and
		  star formation. In both hydrodynamic simulations, the
		  clustering of the gas is suppressed while that of dark
		  matter is boosted at scales k>1 h Mpc-1. Despite this
		  counterbalance between dark matter and gas, the clustering
		  of the total matter is suppressed by up to 1% at 1 h
		  Mpc-1<~k<~10 h Mpc-1, while for k~20 h Mpc-1 it is boosted,
		  up to 2% in the nonradiative run and 10% in the run with
		  star formation. The stellar mass formed in the latter is
		  highly biased relative to the dark matter in the pure
		  N-body simulation. Using our power spectrum measurements to
		  predict the effect of baryons on the weak-lensing signal at
		  scales corresponding to multipole moments 100<l<10,000, we
		  find that baryons may change the lensing power spectrum by
		  less than 0.5% at l<1000, but by 1% to 10% at
		  1000<l<10,000. The size of the effect exceeds the predicted
		  accuracy of future lensing power spectrum measurements and
		  will likely be detected. Precise determinations of
		  cosmological parameters with weak lensing, and studies of
		  small-scale fluctuations and clustering, therefore rely on
		  properly including baryonic physics.},

		  physically motivated model, the anisotropic baryonic
		  acoustic feature in the galaxy sample is detected at a

	Abstract = {Consistency relations involving the soft limit of the (n +
		  1)-correlator functions of dark matter and galaxy
		  overdensities can be obtained, both in real and redshift
		  space, thanks to the symmetries enjoyed by the Newtonian
		  equations of motion describing the dark matter and galaxy
		  fluids coupled through gravity. We study the implications
		  of such symmetries for the theory of galaxy bias and for
		  the theories of modified gravity. We find that the
		  invariance of the fluid equations under a coordinate
		  transformation that induces a long-wavelength velocity
		  constrain the bias to depend only on a set of invariants,
		  while the symmetry of such equations under Lifshitz
		  scalings in the case of matter domination allows one to
		  compute the time-dependence of the coefficients in the bias
		  expansion. We also find that in theories of modified
		  gravity which violate the equivalence principle induce a
		  violation of the consistency relation which may be a
		  signature for their observation. Thus, given adiabatic
		  Gaussian initial conditions, the observation of a deviation
		  from the consistency relation for galaxies would signal a
		  break-down of the so-called non-local Eulerian bias model
		  or the violation of the equivalence principle in the
		  underlying theory of gravity.},

	Abstract = {Cosmic shear is the distortion of images of distant
		  galaxies due to weak gravitational lensing by the
		  large-scale structure in the Universe. Such images are
		  coherently deformed by the tidal field of matter
		  inhomogeneities along the line of sight. By measuring
		  galaxy shape correlations, we can study the properties and
		  evolution of structure on large scales as well as the
		  geometry of the Universe. Thus, cosmic shear has become a
		  powerful probe into the nature of dark matter and the
		  origin of the current accelerated expansion of the
		  Universe. Over the last years, cosmic shear has evolved
		  into a reliable and robust cosmological probe, providing
		  measurements of the expansion history of the Universe and
		  the growth of its structure. We review here the principles
		  of weak gravitational lensing and show how cosmic shear is
		  interpreted in a cosmological context. Then we give an
		  overview of weak-lensing measurements, and present the main
		  observational cosmic-shear results since it was discovered
		  15 years ago, as well as the implications for cosmology. We
		  then conclude with an outlook on the various future surveys
		  and missions, for which cosmic shear is one of the main

		  cosmological lensing techniques for future observations.},

	Abstract = {Peculiar velocity surveys, which measure galaxy peculiar
		  velocities directly from standard candles in addition to
		  redshifts, can provide strong constraints on the linear
		  growth rate of cosmological large-scale structure at low
		  redshift. The improvement originates from the physical
		  relationship between galaxy density and peculiar velocity,
		  which substantially reduces cosmic variance. We present the
		  results of Fisher matrix forecasts of correlated fields of
		  galaxy density and velocity. Peculiar velocity can improve
		  the growth rate constraints by about a factor of two
		  compared to density alone, if we can use all the
		  information for wavenumber k < 0.2 h/Mpc. Future peculiar
		  velocity surveys, TAIPAN, and the all-sky HI surveys,
		  WALLABY and WNSHS, can measure the growth rate, f*sigma8 to
		  3 per cent at z ~ 0.025. Although the velocity subsample is
		  about an order of magnitude smaller than the redshift
		  sample from the same survey, it improves the constraint by
		  40 per cent compared to the same survey without velocity
		  measurements. Peculiar velocity surveys can also measure
		  the growth rate as a function of wavenumber with 15-30 per
		  cent uncertainties in bins with widths 0.01 h/Mpc in the
		  range 0.02 h/Mpc < k < 0.1 h/Mpc, which is a large
		  improvement over galaxy density only. Such measurements on
		  very large scales can detect signatures of modified gravity
		  or non-Gaussianity through scale-dependent growth rate or
		  galaxy bias. We use N-body simulations to improve the
		  modelling of auto- and cross-power spectra of galaxy
		  density and peculiar velocity by introducing a new
		  redshift-space distortion term to the velocity, which has
		  been neglected in previous studies. The velocity power
		  spectrum has a damping in redshift space, which is larger
		  than that naively expected from the similar effect in the
		  galaxy power spectrum.},

@article{ludlow:2011fk,
	Abstract = {We use two cosmological simulations of structure formation
		  to study the conditions under which dark matter haloes
		  emerge from the linear density field. Our analysis focuses
		  on matching sites of halo collapse to local density maxima,
		  or 'peaks', in the initial conditions of the simulations
		  and provides a crucial test of the central ansatz of the
		  peaks formalism. By identifying peaks on a variety of
		  smoothed, linearly extrapolated density fields, we
		  demonstrate that as many as ??70 per cent of well-resolved
		  dark matter haloes form preferentially near peaks whose
		  characteristic masses are similar to those of the halo,
		  with more massive haloes showing a stronger tendency to
		  reside near peaks initially. We identify a small but
		  significant fraction of haloes that appear to evolve from
		  peaks of substantially lower mass than that of the halo
		  itself. We refer to these as 'peakless haloes' for
		  convenience. By contrasting directly the properties of
		  these objects with the bulk of the protohalo population, we
		  find two clear differences: (1) their initial shapes are
		  significantly flatter and more elongated than the
		  predominantly triaxial majority and (2) they are, on
		  average, more strongly compressed by tidal forces
		  associated with their surrounding large-scale structure.
		  Using the two-point correlation function, we show that
		  peakless haloes tend to emerge from highly clustered
		  regions of the initial density field implying that, at
		  fixed mass, the accretion geometry and mass accretion
		  histories of haloes in highly clustered environments differ
		  significantly from those in the field. This may have
		  important implications for understanding the origin of the
		  halo assembly bias, of galaxy properties in dense
		  environments and how environment affects the morphological
		  transformation of galaxies near groups and rich galaxy
		  clusters.},

	Abstract = {We present an analytic model for the fully nonlinear two-
		  and three-point correlation functions of the cosmological
		  mass density field, and their Fourier transforms, the mass
		  power spectrum and bispectrum. The model is based on
		  physical properties of dark matter halos, with the three
		  main model inputs being analytic halo density profiles,
		  halo mass functions, and halo-halo spatial correlations,
		  each of which has been well studied in the literature. We
		  demonstrate that this new model can reproduce the power
		  spectrum and bispectrum computed from cosmological
		  simulations of both an n=-2 scale-free model and a
		  low-density cold dark matter model. To enhance the dynamic
		  range of these large simulations, we use the synthetic-halo
		  replacement technique of Ma & Fry, in which the original
		  halos with numerically softened cores are replaced by
		  synthetic halos of realistic density profiles. At high
		  wavenumbers, our model predicts a slope for the nonlinear
		  power spectrum different from the often-used fitting
		  formulas in the literature based on the stable-clustering
		  assumption. Our model also predicts a three-point
		  amplitude, Q, that is scale dependent, in contrast to the
		  popular hierarchical clustering assumption. This model
		  provides a rapid way to compute the mass power spectrum and
		  bispectrum over all length scales where the input halo
		  properties are valid. It also provides a physical
		  interpretation of the clustering properties of matter in
		  the universe.},

	Abstract = {Standard cosmological perturbation theory (SPT) for the
		  Large Scale Structure (LSS) of the Universe fails at small
		  scales (UV) due to strong nonlinearities and to
		  multistreaming effects. In Pietroni et al. 2011 a new
		  framework was proposed in which the large scales (IR) are
		  treated perturbatively while the information on the UV,
		  mainly small scale velocity dispersion, is obtained by
		  nonlinear methods like N-body simulations. Here we develop
		  this approach, showing that it is possible to reproduce the
		  fully nonlinear power spectrum (PS) by combining a simple
		  (and fast) 1-loop computation for the IR scales and the
		  measurement of a single, dominant, correlator from N-body
		  simulations for the UV ones. We measure this correlator for
		  a suite of seven different cosmologies, and we show that
		  its inclusion in our perturbation scheme reproduces the
		  fully non-linear PS with percent level accuracy, for wave
		  numbers up to $k\sim 0.4\, h~{\rm Mpc^{-1}}$ down to $z=0$.
		  We then show that, once this correlator has been measured
		  in a given cosmology, there is no need to run a new
		  simulation for a different cosmology in the suite. Indeed,
		  by rescaling this correlator by a proper function
		  computable in SPT, the reconstruction procedure works also
		  for the other cosmologies and for all redshifts, with
		  comparable accuracy. Finally, we clarify the relation of
		  this approach to the Effective Field Theory methods
		  recently proposed in the LSS context.},

	Abstract = {We develop a novel abundance matching method to construct
		  a mock catalogue of luminous red galaxies (LRGs) in the
		  Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), using catalogues of haloes
		  and subhaloes in N-body simulations for a Lambda-dominated
		  cold dark matter model. Motivated by observations
		  suggesting that LRGs are passively evolving, massive
		  early-type galaxies with a typical age ???5 Gyr, we assume
		  that simulated haloes at z = 2 (z2-halo) are progenitors
		  for LRG-host subhaloes observed today, and we label the
		  most tightly bound particles in each progenitor z2-halo as
		  LRG `stars'. We then identify the subhaloes containing
		  these stars to z = 0.3 (SDSS redshift) in descending order
		  of the masses of z2-haloes until the comoving number
		  density of the matched subhaloes becomes comparable to the
		  measured number density of SDSS LRGs, bar{n}_LRG=10^{-4}
		  h^3 Mpc^{-3}. Once the above prescription is determined,
		  our only free parameter is the number density of haloes
		  identified at z = 2 and this parameter is fixed to match
		  the observed number density at z = 0.3. By tracing
		  subsequent merging and assembly histories of each
		  progenitor z2-halo, we can directly compute, from the mock
		  catalogue, the distributions of central and satellite LRGs
		  and their internal motions in each host halo at z = 0.3.
		  While the SDSS LRGs are galaxies selected by the magnitude
		  and colour cuts from the SDSS images and are not
		  necessarily a stellar-mass-selected sample, our mock
		  catalogue reproduces a host of SDSS measurements: the halo
		  occupation distribution for central and satellite LRGs, the
		  projected autocorrelation function of LRGs, the
		  cross-correlation of LRGs with shapes of background
		  galaxies (LRG-galaxy weak lensing) and the non-linear
		  redshift-space distortion effect, the Finger-of-God effect,
		  in the angle-averaged redshift-space power spectrum. The
		  mock catalogue generated based on our method can be used
		  for removing or calibrating systematic errors in the
		  cosmological interpretation of LRG clustering measurements
		  as well as for understanding the nature of LRGs such as
		  their formation and assembly histories.},

	Abstract = {We apply the integrated perturbation theory [T. Matsubara,
		  Phys. Rev. D 83, 083518 (2011)] to evaluate the
		  scale-dependent bias in the presence of primordial
		  non-Gaussianity. The integrated perturbation theory is a
		  general framework of nonlinear perturbation theory, in
		  which a broad class of bias models can be incorporated into
		  perturbative evaluations of biased power spectrum and
		  higher-order polyspectra. Approximations such as the
		  high-peak limit or the peak-background split are not
		  necessary to derive the scale-dependent bias in this
		  framework. Applying the halo approach, previously known
		  formulas are rederived as limiting cases of a general
		  formula in this work, and it is implied that modifications
		  should be made in general situations. Effects of
		  redshift-space distortions are straightforwardly
		  incorporated. It is found that the slope of the
		  scale-dependent bias on large scales is determined only by
		  the behavior of primordial bispectrum in the squeezed limit
		  and is not sensitive to bias models in general. It is the
		  amplitude of scale-dependent bias that is sensitive to the
		  bias models. The effects of redshift-space distortions turn
		  out to be quite small for the monopole component of the
		  power spectrum, while the quadrupole component is
		  proportional to the monopole component on large scales and
		  thus also sensitive to the primordial non-Gaussianity.},

	Abstract = {Large-scale bulk flows in the universe distort the initial
		  density field, broadening the baryon-acoustic-oscillation
		  (BAO) feature that was imprinted when baryons were strongly
		  coupled to photons. Additionally, there is a small shift
		  inward in the peak of the conventional overdensity
		  correlation function, a mass-weighted statistic. This shift
		  occurs when high-density peaks move toward each other. We
		  explore whether this shift can be removed by applying to
		  the density field a transform (such as a logarithm) that
		  gives fairer statistical weight to fluctuations in
		  underdense regions. Using configuration-space perturbation
		  theory in the Zel'dovich approximation, we find that the
		  log-density correlation function shows a much smaller
		  inward shift in the position of the BAO peak at low
		  redshift than is seen in the overdensity correlation
		  function. We also show that if the initial, Lagrangian
		  density of matter parcels could be estimated at their
		  Eulerian positions, giving a displaced-initial-density
		  field, its peak shift would be even smaller. In fact, a
		  transformed field that accentuates underdensities, such as
		  the reciprocal of the density, pushes the peak the other
		  way, outward. In our model, these shifts in the peak
		  position can be attributed to shift terms, involving the
		  derivative of the linear correlation function, that
		  entirely vanish in this displaced-initial-density field.},

@article{mcdonald06,
	Abstract = {A commonly used perturbative method for computing
		  large-scale clustering of tracers of mass density, like
		  galaxies, is to model the tracer density field as a Taylor
		  series in the local smoothed mass density fluctuations,
		  possibly adding a stochastic component. I suggest a set of
		  parameter redefinitions, eliminating problematic
		  perturbative correction terms, that should represent a
		  modest improvement, at least, to this method. As presented
		  here, my method can be used to compute the power spectrum
		  and bispectrum to 4th order in initial density
		  perturbations, and higher order extensions should be
		  straightforward. While the model is technically unchanged
		  at this order, just reparametrized, the renormalized model
		  is more elegant, and should have better convergence
		  behavior, for three reasons: First, in the usual approach
		  the effects of beyond-linear-order bias parameters can be
		  seen at asymptotically large scales, while after
		  renormalization the linear model is preserved in the
		  large-scale limit, i.e., the effects of higher order bias
		  parameters are restricted to relatively high k. Second,
		  while the standard approach includes smoothing to suppress
		  large perturbative correction terms, resulting in
		  dependence on the arbitrary cutoff scale, no
		  cutoff-sensitive terms appear explicitly after my
		  redefinitions (and, relatedly, my correction terms are less
		  sensitive to high-k, nonlinear, power). Third, the 3rd
		  order bias parameter disappears entirely, so my model has
		  one fewer free parameter than usual (this parameter was
		  redundant at the order considered). This model predicts no
		  significant modification of the baryonic acoustic
		  oscillation (BAO) signal, in real space, supporting the
		  robustness of BAO as a probe of dark energy, and providing
		  a complete perturbative description over the relevant range
		  of scales.},

	Abstract = {We present and test a method for modifying the catalogue
		  of dark matter haloes produced from a given cosmological
		  simulation, so that it resembles the result of a simulation
		  with an entirely different set of parameters. This extends
		  the method of Angulo & White, which rescales the full
		  particle distribution from a simulation. Working directly
		  with the halo catalogue offers an advantage in speed, and
		  also allows modifications of the internal structure of the
		  haloes to account for non-linear differences between
		  cosmologies. Our method can be used directly on a halo
		  catalogue in a self-contained manner without any additional
		  information about the overall density field; although the
		  large-scale displacement field is required by the method,
		  this can be inferred from the halo catalogue alone. We show
		  proof of concept of our method by rescaling a matter-only
		  simulation with no baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO)
		  features to a more standard Lambda cold dark matter model
		  containing a cosmological constant and a BAO signal. In
		  conjunction with the halo occupation approach, this method
		  provides a basis for the rapid generation of mock galaxy
		  samples spanning a wide range of cosmological parameters.},

	Abstract = {We develop an extension of \textit{the Halo Model} that
		  describes analytically the corrections to the matter power
		  spectrum due to the physics of baryons. We extend these
		  corrections to the weak-lensing shear angular power
		  spectrum. Within each halo, our baryonic model accounts
		  for: 1) a central galaxy, the major stellar component whose
		  properties are derived from abundance matching techniques;
		  2) a hot plasma in hydrostatic equilibrium and 3) an
		  adiabatically-contracted dark matter component. This
		  analytic approach allows us to compare our model to the
		  dark-matter-only case. Our basic assumptions are tested
		  against the hydrodynamical simulations of Martizzi et. al.
		  (2014), with which a remarkable agreement is found. Our
		  baryonic model has only one free parameter, $M_{\rm crit}$,
		  the critical halo mass that marks the transition between
		  feedback-dominated halos, mostly devoid of gas, and gas
		  rich halos, in which AGN feedback effects become weaker. We
		  explore the entire cosmological parameter space, using the
		  angular power spectrum in three redshift bins as the
		  observable, assuming a Euclid-like survey. We derive the
		  corresponding constraints on the cosmological parameters,
		  as well as the possible bias introduced by neglecting the
		  effects of baryonic physics. We find that, up to
		  $\ell_{max}$=4000, baryonic physics plays very little role
		  in the cosmological parameters estimation. However, if one
		  goes up to $\ell_{max}$=8000, the marginalized errors on
		  the cosmological parameters can be significantly reduced,
		  but neglecting baryonic physics can lead to bias in the
		  recovered cosmological parameters up to 10$\sigma$. These
		  biases are removed if one takes into account the main
		  baryonic parameter, $M_{\rm crit}$, which can also be
		  determined up to 1-2\%, along with the other cosmological
		  parameters.},

	Abstract = {We present an experiment in which we `ring' a set of
		  cosmological N-body- simulation initial conditions, placing
		  spikes in the initial power spectrum at different
		  wavenumber bins. We then measure where these spikes end up
		  in the final conditions. In the usual overdensity power
		  spectrum, most sensitive to contracting and collapsing
		  dense regions, initial power on slightly non-linear scales
		  (k ?? 0.3 h Mpc-1) smears to smaller scales, coming to
		  dominate the initial power once there. Log-density and
		  Gaussianized-density power spectra, sensitive to
		  low-density (expanding) and high-density regions, respond
		  differently: initial spikes spread symmetrically in scale,
		  both upwards and downwards. In fact, in the power spectrum
		  of 1/(1 + delta), spikes migrate to larger scales, showing
		  the magnifying effect of voids on small-scale modes. These
		  power spectra show much greater sensitivity to small-scale
		  initial features. We also test the difference between an
		  approximation of the Lyalpha flux field and its
		  Gaussianized form, and give a toy model that qualitatively
		  explains the symmetric power spreading in
		  Gaussianized-density power spectra. Also, we discuss how to
		  use this framework to estimate power-spectrum covariance
		  matrices. This can be used to track the fate of information
		  in the Universe that takes the form of initial degrees of
		  freedom, one random spike per initial mode.},

	Abstract = {We consider nonlinear biasing models of galaxies with
		  particular attention to a correlation between the linear
		  and quadratic biasing coefficients, b1 and b2. We first
		  derive perturbative expressions for b1 and b2 in halo and
		  peak biasing models. We then discuss our computations of
		  the power spectra and bispectra of dark matter particles
		  and halos using N-body simulation data and of
		  volume-limited subsamples of Sloan Digital Sky Survey
		  (SDSS) galaxies, and determine their b1 and b2. We find
		  that the values of those coefficients at linear regimes (k
		  < 0.2 h Mpc-1) are fairly insensitive to the redshift-space
		  distortion and the survey volume shape. The resulting
		  normalized amplitudes of the bispectra, Q, for equilateral
		  triangles are insensitive to the values of b1, implying
		  that b2 indeed correlates with b1. The present results
		  explain the previous finding of Kayo et al. (2004, PASJ,
		  56, 415) for the hierarchical relation of three-point
		  correlation functions of SDSS galaxies. While the relations
		  between b1 and b2 are quantitatively different for specific
		  biasing models, their approximately similar correlations
		  indicate a fairly generic outcome of the biasing due to the
		  gravity in primordial Gaussian density fields.},

		  The resultant scaling on the triangular shape is consistent

	Abstract = {The large-scale clustering pattern of biased tracers is
		  known to be a powerful probe of the non-Gaussianities in
		  the primordial fluctuations. The so-called scale-dependent
		  bias has been reported in various type of models of
		  primordial non-Gaussianities. We focus on local-type
		  non-Gaussianities, and unify the derivations in the
		  literature of the scale-dependent bias in the presence of
		  multiple Gaussian source fields as well as higher-order
		  coupling to cover the models described by
		  frequently-discussed fNL, gNL and tNL parameterization. We
		  find that the resultant power spectrum is characterized by
		  two parameters responsible for the shape and the amplitude
		  of the scale-dependent bias in addition to the Gaussian
		  bias factor. We show how (a generalized version of)
		  Suyama-Yamaguchi inequality between fNL and tNL can
		  directly be accessible from the observed power spectrum
		  through the dependence on our new parameter which controls
		  the shape of the scale-dependent bias. The other parameter
		  for the amplitude of the scale-dependent bias is shown to
		  be useful to distinguish the simplest quadratic
		  non-Gaussianities (i.e., fNL-type) from higher-order ones
		  (gNL and higher), if one measures it from multiple species

	Abstract = {The anisotropic galaxy clustering on large scales provides
		  us with a unique opportunity to probe into the gravity
		  theory through the redshift-space distortions (RSDs) and
		  the Alcock-Paczynski effect. Using the multipole power
		  spectra up to hexadecapole, of the Luminous Red Galaxy
		  (LRG) sample in the data release 7 (DR7) of the Sloan
		  Digital Sky Survey II (SDSS-II), we obtain simultaneous
		  constraints on the linear growth rate f, angular diameter
		  distance D_{A}, and Hubble parameter H at redshift z = 0.3.
		  For this purpose, we first extensively examine the validity
		  of a theoretical model for the non-linear RSDs using mock
		  subhalo catalogues from N-body simulations, which are
		  constructed to match with the observed multipole power
		  spectra. We show that the input cosmological parameters of
		  the simulations can be recovered well within the error bars
		  by comparing the multipole power spectra of our theoretical
		  model and those of the mock subhalo catalogues. We also
		  examine systematic uncertainties in our analysis by testing
		  the dependence on prior assumption of the theoretical model
		  and the range of wavenumbers to be used in the fitting.
		  These investigations validate that the theoretical model
		  can be safely applied to the real data. Thus, our results
		  from the SDSS DR7 LRG sample, f (z = 0.3) =0.71 +- 0.12,
		  D_{A} (z = 0.3) =968 +- 42[Mpc], H (z = 0.3) =81.7 +-
		  5.0[km/s/Mpc], are robust against such systematics of
		  theoretical modeling. We believe that our method to
		  constrain the cosmological parameters using subhaloes
		  catalogues will be useful for more refined samples like
		  CMASS and LOWZ catalogues in the Baryon Oscillation
		  Spectroscopic Survey in SDSS-III.},

		  On the other hand, in all redshift ranges, the higher-order

	Abstract = {We study the large-scale anisotropic two-point correlation
		  function using 46,760 luminous red galaxies at redshifts
		  0.16-0.47 from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We measure the
		  correlation function as a function of separations parallel
		  and perpendicular to the line of sight in order to take
		  account of anisotropy of the large-scale structure in
		  redshift space. We find a slight signal of baryonic
		  features in the anisotropic correlation function, i.e., a
		  ``baryon ridge'' corresponding to a baryon acoustic peak in
		  the spherically averaged correlation function, which has
		  already been reported using the same sample. The baryon
		  ridge has primarily a spherical structure with a known
		  radius in comoving coordinates. It enables us to divide the
		  redshift distortion effects into dynamical and geometrical
		  components and provides further constraints on cosmological
		  parameters, including the dark energy equation-of-state.
		  With an assumption of a flat Lambda cosmology, we find the
		  best-fit values of Omegam=0.218+0.047-0.037 and
		  Omegab=0.047+/-0.016 (68% CL) when we use the overall shape
		  of the anisotropic correlation function of 40<s<200 h-1 Mpc
		  including a scale of baryon acoustic oscillations. When an
		  additional assumption of Omegabh2=0.024 is adopted, we
		  obtain OmegaDE=0.770+0.051-0.040 and w=-0.93+0.45-0.35.
		  These constraints are estimated only from our data of the
		  anisotropic correlation function, and they agree quite well
		  with values both from the cosmic microwave background (CMB)
		  anisotropies and from other complementary statistics using
		  the LRG sample. With the CMB prior from the 3 year WMAP
		  results, we give stronger constraints on those
		  parameters.},

	Abstract = {We present an analysis of anisotropic baryon acoustic
		  oscillations and elucidate how a mis-estimation of the
		  cosmology, which leads to incorrect values of the angular
		  diameter distance, dA, and Hubble parameter, H, manifest
		  themselves in changes to the monopole and quadrupole power
		  spectrum of biased tracers of the density field. Previous
		  work has focused on the monopole power spectrum, and shown
		  that the isotropic dilation combination dA2H-1 is robustly
		  constrained by an overall shift in the scale of the baryon
		  feature. We extend this by demonstrating that the
		  quadrupole power spectrum is sensitive to an anisotropic
		  warping mode dAH, allowing one to break the degeneracy
		  between dA and H. We describe a method for measuring this
		  warping, explicitly marginalizing over the form of
		  redshift-space distortions. We verify this method on N-body
		  simulations and estimate that dAH can be measured with a
		  fractional accuracy of ??(3/V)% where the survey volume is

@article{padmanabhan09b,
	Abstract = {We characterize the nonlinear evolution of the baryon
		  acoustic feature as traced by the dark matter and halos,
		  using a combination of perturbation theory and N-body
		  simulations. We confirm that the acoustic peak traced by
		  the dark matter is both broadened and shifted as structure
		  forms, and that this shift is well described by
		  second-order perturbation theory. These shifts persist for
		  dark matter halos, and are a simple function of halo bias,
		  with the shift (mostly) increasing with increasing bias.
		  Extending our perturbation theory results to halos with
		  simple two parameter bias models (both in Lagrangian and
		  Eulerian space) quantitatively explains the observed
		  shifts. In particular, we demonstrate that there are
		  additional terms that contribute to the shift that are
		  absent for the matter. At z=0 for currently favored
		  cosmologies, the matter shows shifts of ??0.5%, b=1 halos
		  shift the acoustic scale by ??0.2%, while b=2 halos shift
		  it by ??0.5%; these shifts decrease by the square of the
		  growth factor D(z) at higher redshifts. These results are
		  easily generalized to galaxies within the halo model, where
		  we show that simple galaxy models show marginally larger
		  shifts than the correspondingly biased halos, due to the
		  contribution of satellites in high mass halos. While our
		  focus here is on real space, our results make specific
		  predictions for redshift space. For currently favored
		  cosmological models, we find that the shifts for halos at
		  z=0 increase by ??0.3%; at high z, they increase by
		  ??0.5%D2. Our results demonstrate that these theoretical
		  systematics are smaller than the statistical precision of
		  upcoming surveys, even if one ignored the corrections
		  discussed here. Simple modeling, along the lines discussed
		  here, has the potential to reduce these systematics to
		  below the levels of cosmic variance limited surveys.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents cosmological results from the final
		  data release of the WiggleZ Dark Energy Survey. We perform
		  full analyses of different cosmological models using the
		  WiggleZ power spectra measured at z=0.22, 0.41, 0.60, and
		  0.78, combined with other cosmological data sets. The
		  limiting factor in this analysis is the theoretical
		  modeling of the galaxy power spectrum, including
		  nonlinearities, galaxy bias, and redshift-space
		  distortions. In this paper we assess several different
		  methods for modeling the theoretical power spectrum,
		  testing them against the Gigaparsec WiggleZ simulations
		  (GiggleZ). We fit for a base set of six cosmological
		  parameters, {Omegabh2,OmegaCDMh2,H0,tau,As,ns}, and five
		  supplementary parameters {nrun,r,w,Omegak,???mnu}. In
		  combination with the cosmic microwave background, our
		  results are consistent with the LambdaCDM concordance
		  cosmology, with a measurement of the matter density of
		  Omegam=0.29$\pm$0.016 and amplitude of fluctuations
		  sigma8=0.825$\pm$0.017. Using WiggleZ data with cosmic
		  microwave background and other distance and matter power
		  spectra data, we find no evidence for any of the extension
		  parameters being inconsistent with their LambdaCDM model
		  values. The power spectra data and theoretical modeling
		  tools are available for use as a module for CosmoMC, which
		  we here make publicly available at

@article{peacock01,
	Abstract = {The large-scale structure in the distribution of galaxies
		  is thought to arise from the gravitational instability of
		  small fluctuations in the initial density field of the
		  Universe. A key test of this hypothesis is that forming
		  superclusters of galaxies should generate a systematic
		  infall of other galaxies. This would be evident in the
		  pattern of recessional velocities, causing an anisotropy in
		  the inferred spatial clustering of galaxies. Here we report
		  a precise measurement of this clustering, using the
		  redshifts of more than 141,000 galaxies from the
		  two-degree-field (2dF) galaxy redshift survey. We determine
		  the parameter beta = Omega0.6/<ITALIC>b</ITALIC> = 0.43 +/-
		  0.07, where Omega is the total mass-density parameter of
		  the Universe and b is a measure of the `bias' of the
		  luminous galaxies in the survey. (Bias is the difference
		  between the clustering of visible galaxies and of the total
		  mass, most of which is dark.) Combined with the anisotropy
		  of the cosmic microwave background, our results favour a
		  low-density Universe with Omega ~ 0.3.},

	Abstract = {We propose a heuristic model that displays the main
		  features of realistic theories for galaxy bias. We first
		  show that the low-order clustering statistics of the
		  dark-matter distribution depend almost entirely on the
		  locations and density profiles of dark-matter haloes. The
		  quasi-linear mass correlations are in fact reproduced well
		  by a model of independent randomly-placed haloes. The
		  distribution of galaxies within the halo density field
		  depends on: (i) the efficiency of galaxy formation, as
		  manifested by the halo occupation number - the number of
		  galaxies brighter than some sample limit contained in a
		  halo of a given mass; (ii) the location of these galaxies
		  within their halo. The first factor is constrained by the
		  empirical luminosity function of groups. For the second
		  factor, we assume that one galaxy marks the halo centre,
		  with any remaining galaxies acting as satellites that trace
		  the halo mass. This second assumption is essential if
		  small-scale galaxy correlations are to remain close to a
		  single power law, rather than flattening in the same way as
		  the correlations of the overall density field. These simple
		  assumptions amount to a recipe for non-local bias, in which
		  the probability of finding a galaxy is not a simple
		  function of its local mass density. We have applied this
		  prescription to some CDM models of current interest, and
		  find that the predictions are close to the observed galaxy
		  correlations for a flat Omega=0.3 model (LambdaCDM), but
		  not for an Omega=1 model with the same power spectrum
		  (tauCDM). This is an inevitable consequence of cluster
		  normalization for the power spectra: cluster-scale haloes
		  of given mass have smaller core radii for high Omega, and
		  hence display enhanced small-scale clustering. Finally, the
		  pairwise velocity dispersion of galaxies in the LambdaCDM
		  model is lower than that of the mass, allowing
		  cluster-normalized models to yield a realistic Mach number
		  for the peculiar velocity field. This is largely due to the
		  strong variation of galaxy-formation efficiency with halo
		  mass that is required in this model.},

		  squeezed bispectrum of Large Scale Structure. These
		  relations hold when the matter component of the Universe is

		  obtained in Peloso, Pietroni '13 and Kehagias, Riotto '13
		  in the single species case. The multi-species relations
		  apply to the standard dark matter + baryons scenario, as
		  well as to the case in which some of the fields are
		  auxiliary quantities describing a particular population,
		  such as dark matter halos or a specific galaxy class. If a
		  large scale velocity bias exists between the different
		  populations new terms appear in the consistency relations
		  with respect to the single species case. As an
		  illustration, we discuss two physical cases in which such a
		  velocity bias can exist: (1) a new long range scalar force
		  in the dark matter sector (resulting in a violation of the
		  equivalence principle in the dark matter-baryon system),
		  and (2) the distribution of dark matter halos relative to
		  that of the underlying dark matter field.},

	Abstract = {The Planck nominal mission cosmic microwave background
		  (CMB) maps yield unprecedented constraints on primordial
		  non-Gaussianity (NG). Using three optimal bispectrum
		  estimators, separable template-fitting (KSW), binned, and
		  modal, we obtain consistent values for the primordial
		  local, equilateral, and orthogonal bispectrum amplitudes,
		  quoting as our final result f_NL^local=2.7 +/- 5.8,
		  f_NL^equil= -42 +/- 75, and f_NL^ortho= -25 +/- 39 (68% CL
		  statistical); and we find the
		  Integrated-Sachs-Wolfe-lensing bispectrum expected in the
		  LambdaCDM scenario. The results are based on comprehensive
		  cross-validation of these estimators on Gaussian and
		  non-Gaussian simulations, are stable across component
		  separation techniques, pass an extensive suite of tests,
		  and are confirmed by skew-C_l, wavelet bispectrum and
		  Minkowski functional estimators. Beyond estimates of
		  individual shape amplitudes, we present model-independent,
		  three-dimensional reconstructions of the Planck CMB
		  bispectrum and thus derive constraints on early-Universe
		  scenarios that generate primordial NG, including general
		  single-field models of inflation, excited initial states
		  (non-Bunch-Davies vacua), and directionally-dependent
		  vector models. We provide an initial survey of
		  scale-dependent feature and resonance models. These results
		  bound both general single-field and multi-field model
		  parameter ranges, such as the speed of sound, c_s \geq 0.02
		  (95% CL), in an effective field theory parametrization, and
		  the curvaton decay fraction r_D \geq 0.15 (95% CL). The
		  Planck data put severe pressure on ekpyrotic/cyclic
		  scenarios. The amplitude of the four-point function in the
		  local model tau_NL< 2800 (95% CL). Taken together, these
		  constraints represent the highest precision tests to date
		  of physical mechanisms for the origin of cosmic structure.},

	Abstract = {Future dark energy experiments will require better and
		  more accurate theoretical predictions for the baryonic
		  acoustic oscillations (BAO) signature in the spectrum of
		  cosmological perturbations. Here, we use large N-body
		  simulations of the \LambdaCDM Planck cosmology to study any
		  possible systematic shifts and damping in BAO due to the
		  impact of nonlinear gravitational growth of structure,
		  scale dependent and non-local bias, and redshift-space
		  distortions. The effect of cosmic variance is largely
		  reduced by dividing the tracer power spectrum by that from
		  a BAO-free simulation starting with the same phases. This
		  permits us to study with unprecedented accuracy (better
		  than 0.02% for dark matter and 0.07% for low-bias halos)
		  small shifts of the pristine BAO wavenumbers towards larger
		  k, and non-linear damping of BAO wiggles in the power
		  spectrum of dark matter and halo populations in the
		  redshift range z=0-1. For dark matter, we provide an
		  accurate parametrization of the evolution of \alpha as a
		  function of the linear growth factor D(z). For halo
		  samples, with bias ranging from 1.2 to 2.8, we measure a
		  typical BAO shift of ~0.25%, observed in real-space, which
		  does not show an appreciable evolution with redshift within
		  the uncertainties. Moreover, we report a constant shift as
		  a function of halo bias. We find a different evolution of
		  the damping of the acoustic feature in all halo samples as
		  compared to dark matter with haloes suffering less damping,
		  and also find some weak dependence on bias. A larger BAO
		  shift and damping is measured in redshift-space which can
		  be well explained by linear theory due to redshift-space
		  distortions. A clear modulation in phase with the acoustic
		  scale is observed in the scale-dependent halo bias due to
		  the presence of the baryonic acoustic oscillations.},

	Abstract = {We present a study of the substructure finder dependence
		  of subhalo clustering in the Aquarius Simulation. We run 11
		  different subhalo finders on the haloes of the Aquarius
		  Simulation and study their differences in the density
		  profile, mass fraction and two-point correlation function
		  of subhaloes in haloes. We also study the mass and vmax
		  dependence of subhalo clustering. As the Aquarius
		  Simulation has been run at different resolutions, we study
		  the convergence with higher resolutions. We find that the
		  agreement between finders is at around the 10 per cent
		  level inside R200 and at intermediate resolutions when a
		  mass threshold is applied, and better than 5 per cent when
		  vmax is restricted instead of mass. However, some
		  discrepancies appear in the highest resolution, underlined
		  by an observed resolution dependence of subhalo clustering.
		  This dependence is stronger for the smallest subhaloes,
		  which are more clustered in the highest resolution, due to
		  the detection of subhaloes within subhaloes (the
		  sub-subhalo term). This effect modifies the mass dependence
		  of clustering in the highest resolutions. We discuss
		  implications of our results for models of subhalo
		  clustering and their relation with galaxy clustering.},

	Abstract = {We use the joint measurement of geometry and growth from
		  anisotropic galaxy clustering in the Baryon Oscillation
		  Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) Data Release 9 (DR9) CMASS
		  sample reported by Reid et al. to constrain dark energy
		  (DE) properties and possible deviations from the general
		  relativity (GR). Assuming GR and taking a prior on the
		  linear matter power spectrum at high redshift from the
		  cosmic microwave background (CMB), anisotropic clustering
		  of the CMASS DR9 galaxies alone constrains Omegam = 0.308
		  $\pm$ 0.022 and 100Omegak = 5.9 $\pm$ 4.8 for w = -1, or w
		  = -0.91 $\pm$ 0.12 for Omegak = 0. When combined with the
		  full CMB likelihood, the addition of the anisotropic
		  clustering measurements to the spherically averaged baryon
		  acoustic oscillation location increases the constraining
		  power on DE by a factor of 4 in a flat cold dark matter
		  (CDM) cosmology with constant DE equation of state w
		  (giving w = -0.87 $\pm$ 0.05). This impressive gain depends
		  on our measurement of both the growth of structure and the
		  Alcock-Paczynski effect, and is not realized when
		  marginalizing over the amplitude of redshift-space
		  distortions. Combining with both the CMB and Type Ia
		  supernovae, we find Omegam = 0.281 $\pm$ 0.014 and
		  1000Omegak = -9.2 $\pm$ 5.0 for w = -1, or w0 = -1.13 $\pm$
		  0.12 and wa = 0.65 $\pm$ 0.36 assuming Omegak = 0. Finally,
		  when a LambdaCDM background expansion is assumed, the
		  combination of our estimate of the growth rate with
		  previous growth measurements provides tight constraints on
		  the parameters describing possible deviations from GR
		  giving gamma = 0.64 $\pm$ 0.05. For one-parameter
		  extensions of the flat LambdaCDM model, we find a ??2sigma
		  preference either for w > -1 or slower growth than in GR.
		  However, the data are fully consistent with the concordance
		  model, and evidence for these additional parameters is
		  weaker than 2sigma.},

	Abstract = {We explore the cosmological implications of the clustering
		  wedges, xi???(s) and xi||(s), of the CMASS Data Release 9
		  sample of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III (SDSS-III)
		  Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey. These clustering
		  wedges are defined by averaging the full two-dimensional
		  correlation function, xi(mu, s), over the ranges 0 < mu <
		  0.5 and 0.5 < mu < 1, respectively. These measurements
		  allow us to constrain the parameter combinations
		  DA(z)/rs(zd) = 9.03 $\pm$ 0.21 and cz/(rs(zd)H(z)) = 12.14
		  $\pm$ 0.43 at the mean redshift of the sample, z = 0.57. We
		  combine the information from the clustering wedges with
		  recent measurements of cosmic microwave background (CMB),
		  baryon acoustic oscillations and Type Ia supernovae to
		  obtain constraints on the cosmological parameters of the
		  standard Lambda cold dark matter (LambdaCDM) model and a
		  number of potential extensions. The information encoded in
		  the clustering wedges is most useful when the dark energy
		  equation of state is allowed to deviate from its standard
		  LambdaCDM value. The combination of all data sets shows no
		  evidence of a deviation from a constant dark energy
		  equation of state, in which case we find wDE = -1.013 $\pm$
		  0.064, in complete agreement with a cosmological constant.
		  We explore potential deviations from general relativity
		  (GR) by constraining the growth rate f(z) = d ln D(a)/d ln
		  a, in which case the combination of the CMASS clustering
		  wedges with CMB data implies f(z = 0.57) =
		  0.719-0.096+0.092, in accordance with the predictions of
		  GR. Our results clearly illustrate the additional

		  with respect to that of angle-averaged quantities.},

     abstract = "{We present cosmological results from the final galaxy clustering data
        set of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey, part of the
        Sloan Digital Sky Survey III. Our combined galaxy sample
        comprises 1.2 million massive galaxies over an effective area of
        9329 deg$^{2}$ and volume of 18.7 Gpc$^{3}$, divided into three
        partially overlapping redshift slices centred at effective
        redshifts 0.38, 0.51 and 0.61. We measure the angular diameter
        distance D$_{M}$ and Hubble parameter H from the baryon acoustic
        oscillation (BAO) method, in combination with a cosmic microwave
        background prior on the sound horizon scale, after applying
        reconstruction to reduce non-linear effects on the BAO feature.
        Using the anisotropic clustering of the pre-reconstruction
        density field, we measure the product D$_{M}$H from the Alcock-
        Paczynski (AP) effect and the growth of structure, quantified by
        f{\ensuremath{\sigma}}$_{8}$(z), from redshift-space distortions
        (RSD). We combine individual measurements presented in seven
        companion papers into a set of consensus values and likelihoods,
        obtaining constraints that are tighter and more robust than
        those from any one method; in particular, the AP measurement
        from sub-BAO scales sharpens constraints from post-
        reconstruction BAOs by breaking degeneracy between D$_{M}$ and
        H. Combined with Planck 2016 cosmic microwave background
        measurements, our distance scale measurements simultaneously
        imply curvature {\ensuremath{\Omega}}$_{K}$ = 0.0003
        {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.0026 and a dark energy equation-of-state
        parameter w = -1.01 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.06, in strong
        affirmation of the spatially flat cold dark matter (CDM) model
        with a cosmological constant ({\ensuremath{\Lambda}}CDM). Our
        RSD measurements of f{\ensuremath{\sigma}}$_{8}$, at 6 per cent
        precision, are similarly consistent with this model. When
        combined with supernova Ia data, we find H$_{0}$ = 67.3
        {\ensuremath{\pm}} 1.0 km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ even for our most
        general dark energy model, in tension with some direct
        measurements. Adding extra relativistic species as a degree of
        freedom loosens the constraint only slightly, to H$_{0}$ = 67.8
        {\ensuremath{\pm}} 1.2 km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. Assuming flat
        {\ensuremath{\Lambda}}CDM, we find {\ensuremath{\Omega}}$_{m}$ =
        0.310 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.005 and H$_{0}$ = 67.6
        {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.5 km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, and we find a 95
        per cent upper limit of 0.16 eV c$^{-2}$ on the neutrino mass
        sum.}",

	Abstract = {Using a diagrammatic approach to Eulerian perturbation
		  theory, we calculate analytically the variance and skewness
		  of the density and velocity divergence induced by
		  gravitational evolution from Gaussian initial conditions,
		  including corrections beyond leading order. Except for the
		  power spectrum, previous calculations in cosmological
		  perturbation theory have been confined to leading order
		  (tree level): we extend these to include loop corrections.
		  For scale-free initial power spectra, P(k) ??kn with -2 <=
		  n <= 2, the one-loop variance sigma2 ??? <delta> = sigma2l
		  + 1.82sigma4l, and the skewness S3 = <delta2>/delta4 = 34/7
		  + 9.8sigma2l, where sigmal is the rms fluctuation of the
		  density field to linear order. (These results depend weakly
		  on the spectral index n, due to the nonlocality of the
		  nonlinear solutions to the equations of motion.) Thus, loop
		  corrections for the (unsmoothed) density field begin to
		  dominate over tree-level contributions (and perturbation
		  theory presumably begins to break down) when sigma2l ~= 1/2
		  For the divergence of the velocity field, loop dominance
		  does not occur until sigma2l ??? 1. We also compute loop
		  corrections to the variance, skewness, and kurtosis for
		  several nonlinear approximation schemes, where the
		  calculation can be easily generalized to one-point
		  cumulants of higher order and arbitrary number of loops. We
		  find that the Zeldovich approximation gives the best
		  approximation to the loop corrections of exact perturbation
		  theory, followed by the linear potential approximation
		  (LPA) and the frozen flow approximation (FFA), in
		  qualitative agreement with the relative behavior of
		  tree-level results. In LPA and FFA, loop corrections are
		  infrared divergent for spectral indices n <= -1; this is
		  related to the breaking of Galilean invariance in these
		  schemes.},

	Abstract = {We study galaxy clustering in the framework of halo
		  models, where gravitational clustering is described in
		  terms of dark matter halos. At small scales, dark matter
		  clustering statistics are dominated by halo density
		  profiles, whereas at large scales, correlations are the
		  result of combining nonlinear perturbation theory with halo
		  biasing. Galaxies are assumed to follow the dark matter
		  profiles of the halo they inhabit, and galaxy formation
		  efficiency is characterized by the number of galaxies that
		  populate a halo of given mass. This approach leads to
		  generic predictions: the galaxy power spectrum shows a
		  power-law behavior even though the dark matter does not,
		  and the galaxy higher order correlations show smaller
		  amplitudes at small scales than their dark matter
		  counterparts. Both are in qualitatively agreement with
		  measurements in galaxy catalogs. We find that requiring the
		  model to fit both the second- and third-order moments of
		  the Automatic Plate Measuring Facility (APM) galaxies
		  provides a strong constraint on galaxy formation models.
		  The data at large scales require that galaxy formation be
		  relatively efficient at small masses, m~1010 Msolar h-1,
		  whereas data at smaller scales require that the number of
		  galaxies in a halo scale approximately as the mass to the
		  0.8th power in the high-mass limit. These constraints are
		  independent of those derived from the luminosity function
		  or Tully-Fisher relation. We also predict the power
		  spectrum, bispectrum, and higher order moments of the mass
		  density field in this framework. Although halo models agree
		  well with measurements of the mass power spectrum and the
		  higher order Sp parameters in N-body simulations, the model
		  assumption that halos are spherical leads to disagreement
		  in the configuration dependence of the bispectrum at small
		  scales. We stress the importance of finite-volume effects
		  in higher order statistics and show how they can be
		  estimated in this approach.},

	Abstract = {We investigate an analytic model to compute the non-linear
		  power spectrum of dark matter, galaxies and their
		  cross-correlation. The model is based on Press-Schechter
		  haloes, which cluster and have realistic dark matter
		  profiles. The total power spectrum is a sum of two
		  contributions, one from correlations between the haloes and
		  one from correlations within the same halo. We show that
		  such a model can give dark matter power spectra which match
		  well with the results of N-body simulations, provided that
		  the concentration parameter decreases with the halo mass.
		  The galaxy power spectrum differs from the dark matter
		  power spectrum because the pair-weighted number of galaxies
		  does not scale with the halo mass and because most haloes
		  harbour a central galaxy. If the pair-weighted number of
		  galaxies increases less rapidly than the halo mass, as
		  predicted by theoretical models and observed in clusters,
		  then the resulting power spectrum becomes a power law with
		  a slope close to the observed over several orders of
		  magnitude in scale. Such a model also predicts a later
		  onset of non-linear clustering in comparison with dark
		  matter, which is needed to reconcile the cold dark matter
		  (CDM) models with the data. A generic prediction of this
		  model is that bias is scale-dependent and non-monotonic.
		  This is particularly important for red or elliptical
		  galaxies, which are preferentially found in larger mass
		  haloes and for which the bias in the power spectrum may be
		  scale-dependent even on large scales. Our predictions for
		  galaxy-dark matter correlations, which can be observed
		  through galaxy-galaxy lensing, show that these cannot be
		  interpreted simply as an average halo profile of a typical
		  galaxy, because different halo masses dominate at different
		  scales and because larger haloes host more than one galaxy.
		  We compute predictions for the cross-correlation
		  coefficient as a function of scale and discuss the
		  prospects of using cross-correlations in combination with
		  galaxy clustering to determine the dark matter power
		  spectrum.},

	Abstract = {We use matter power spectra from cosmological hydrodynamic
		  simulations to quantify the effect of baryon physics on the
		  weak gravitational lensing shear signal. The simulations
		  consider a number of processes, such as radiative cooling,
		  star formation, supernovae and feedback from active
		  galactic nuclei (AGN). Van Daalen et al. used the same
		  simulations to show that baryon physics, in particular the
		  strong feedback that is required to solve the overcooling
		  problem, modifies the matter power spectrum on scales
		  relevant for cosmological weak lensing studies. As a
		  result, the use of power spectra from dark matter
		  simulations can lead to significant biases in the inferred
		  cosmological parameters. We show that the typical biases
		  are much larger than the precision with which future
		  missions aim to constrain the dark energy equation of
		  state, w0. For instance, the simulation with AGN feedback,
		  which reproduces X-ray and optical properties of groups of
		  galaxies, gives rise to a ??40 per cent bias in w0. We also
		  explore the effect of baryon physics on constraints on
		  Omegam, sigma8, the running of the spectral index, the mass
		  of the neutrinos and models of warm dark matter. We
		  demonstrate that the modification of the power spectrum is
		  dominated by groups and clusters of galaxies, the effect of
		  which can be modelled. We consider an approach based on the
		  popular halo model and show that simple modifications can
		  capture the main features of baryonic feedback. Despite its
		  simplicity, we find that our model, when calibrated on the
		  simulations, is able to reduce the bias in w0 to a level
		  comparable to the size of the statistical uncertainties for
		  a Euclid-like mission. While observations of the gas and
		  stellar fractions as a function of halo mass can be used to
		  calibrate the model, hydrodynamic simulations will likely
		  still be needed to extend the observed scaling relations
		  down to halo masses of 1012 h-1 M&sun;.},

	Abstract = {We measure shifts of the acoustic scale due to nonlinear
		  growth and redshift distortions to a high precision using a
		  very large volume of high-orce-esolution simulations. We
		  compare results from various sets of simulations that
		  differ in their force, volume, and mass resolution. We find
		  a consistency within 1.5-igma for shift values from
		  different simulations and derive shift alpha(z) - =
		  (0.300\pm 0.015)% [D(z)/D(0)]^{2} using our fiducial set.
		  We find a strong correlation with a non-nity slope between
		  shifts in real space and in redshift space and a weak
		  correlation between the initial redshift and low redshift.
		  Density-ield reconstruction not only removes the mean
		  shifts and reduces errors on the mean, but also tightens
		  the correlations: after reconstruction, we recover a slope
		  of near unity for the correlation between the real and
		  redshift space and restore a strong correlation between the
		  low and the initial redshifts. We derive propagators and
		  mode-oupling terms from our N-ody simulations and compared
		  with Zeldovich approximation and the shifts measured from
		  the chi^2 fitting, respectively. We interpret the
		  propagator and the mode-oupling term of a nonlinear density
		  field in the context of an average and a dispersion of its
		  complex Fourier coefficients relative to those of the
		  linear density field; from these two terms, we derive a
		  signal-o-oise ratio of the acoustic peak measurement. We
		  attempt to improve our reconstruction method by
		  implementing 2LPT and iterative operations: we obtain
		  little improvement. The Fisher matrix estimates of
		  uncertainty in the acoustic scale is tested using 5000
		  (Gpc/h)^3 of cosmological PM simulations from Takahashi et
		  al. (2009). (abridged)},

	Abstract = {A shift of the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) scale to
		  smaller values than predicted by linear theory was observed
		  in simulations. In this paper, we try to provide an
		  intuitive physical understanding of why this shift occurs,
		  explaining in more pedagogical detail earlier perturbation
		  theory calculations. We find that the shift is mainly due
		  to the following physical effect. A measurement of the BAO
		  scale is more sensitive to regions with long-wavelength
		  overdensities than underdensities, because (due to
		  nonlinear growth and bias) these overdense regions contain
		  larger fluctuations and more tracers and hence contribute
		  more to the total correlation function. In overdense
		  regions the BAO scale shrinks because such regions locally
		  behave as positively curved closed universes, and hence a
		  smaller scale than predicted by linear theory is measured
		  in the total correlation function. Other effects which also
		  contribute to the shift are briefly discussed. We provide
		  approximate analytic expressions for the nonlinear shift
		  including a brief discussion of biased tracers and explain
		  why reconstruction should entirely reverse the shift. Our
		  expressions and findings are in agreement with simulation

	Abstract = {We place constraints on the matter density of the Universe
		  and the amplitude of clustering using measurements of the
		  galaxy two-point correlation function from the Sloan
		  Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We generate model predictions
		  for different cosmologies by populating rescaled N-body
		  simulations with galaxies using the subhalo abundance
		  matching (SHAM) technique. We find OmegaM = 0.29 $\pm$ 0.03
		  and sigma8 = 0.86 $\pm$ 0.04 at 68 per cent confidence by
		  fitting the observed two-point galaxy correlation function
		  of galaxies brighter than Mr = -18 in a volume-limited
		  sample of galaxies obtained by the SDSS. We discuss and
		  quantify potential sources of systematic error and conclude
		  that while there is scope for improving its robustness, the

	Abstract = {The baryonic acoustic signature in the large-cale
		  clustering pattern of galaxies has been detected in the
		  two-oint correlation function. Its precise spatial scale
		  has been forwarded as a rigid-od ruler test for the
		  space-ime geometry, and hence as a probe for tracking the
		  evolution of Dark Energy. Percent-evel shifts in the
		  measured position can bias such a test and erode its power
		  to constrain cosmology. This paper addresses some of the
		  systematic effects that might induce shifts: namely
		  non-inear corrections from matter evolution, redshift space
		  distortions and biasing. We tackle these questions through
		  analytic methods and through a large battery of numerical
		  simulations, with total volume of the order ~100[Gpc\h]^3.
		  A toy-odel calculation shows that if the non-inear
		  corrections simply smooth the acoustic peak, then this
		  gives rise to an `apparent' shifting to smaller scales.
		  However if tilts in the broad band power spectrum are
		  induced then this gives rise to more pernicious `physical'
		  shifts. Our numerical simulations show evidence of both: in
		  real space and at z=0, for the dark matter we find percent
		  level shifts; for haloes the shifts depend on halo mass,
		  with larger shifts being found for the most biased samples,
		  up to 3 percent. From our analysis we find that physical
		  shifts are greater than ~0.4 percent at z=0. In redshift
		  space these effects are exacerbated, but at higher
		  redshifts are alleviated. We develop an analytical model to
		  understand this, based on solutions to the pair
		  conservation equation using characteristic curves. When
		  combined with modeling of pairwise velocities the model
		  reproduces the main trends found in the data. The model may
		  also help to unbias the acoustic peak.},

@article{somerville01,
	Abstract = {We study the biasing relation between dark matter haloes
		  or galaxies and the underlying mass distribution, using
		  cosmological N-body simulations in which galaxies are
		  modelled via semi-analytic recipes. The non-linear,
		  stochastic biasing is quantified in terms of the mean
		  biasing function and the scatter about it as a function of
		  time, scale and object properties. The biasing of galaxies
		  and haloes shows a general similarity and a characteristic
		  shape, with no galaxies in deep voids and a steep slope in
		  moderately underdense regions. At a comoving scale of
		  ~8h-1Mpc, the non-linearity in the biasing relation is
		  typically <~10per cent and the stochasticity is a few tens
		  of per cent, corresponding to ~30per cent variations in the
		  cosmological parameter beta=Omega0.6b. Biasing depends
		  weakly on halo mass, galaxy luminosity, and scale. The
		  observed trend with luminosity is reproduced when dust
		  extinction is included. The time evolution is rapid, with
		  the mean biasing larger by a factor of a few at z~3
		  compared with z=0, and with a minimum for the non-linearity
		  and stochasticity at an intermediate redshift. Biasing
		  today is a weak function of the cosmological model,
		  reflecting the weak dependence on the power-spectrum shape,
		  but the time evolution is more cosmology-dependent,
		  reflecting the effect of the growth rate. We provide
		  predictions for the relative biasing of galaxies of
		  different type and colour, to be compared with upcoming
		  large redshift surveys. Analytic models in which the number
		  of objects is conserved underestimate the evolution of
		  biasing, while models that explicitly account for merging
		  provide a good description of the biasing of haloes and its
		  evolution, suggesting that merging is a crucial element in
		  the evolution of biasing.},

	Abstract = {Measuring the statistics of galaxy peculiar velocities
		  using redshift-space distortions is an excellent way of
		  probing the history of structure formation. Because
		  galaxies are expected to act as test particles within the
		  flow of matter, this method avoids uncertainties due to an
		  unknown galaxy density bias. We show that the parameter
		  combination measured by redshift-space distortions,
		  fsigma8mass provides a good test of dark energy models,
		  even without the knowledge of bias or sigma8mass required
		  to extract f from this measurement (here f is the
		  logarithmic derivative of the linear growth rate, and
		  sigma8mass is the root-mean-square mass fluctuation in
		  spheres with radius 8h-1Mpc). We argue that redshift-space
		  distortion measurements will help to determine the physics
		  behind the cosmic acceleration, testing whether it is
		  related to dark energy or modified gravity, and will
		  provide an opportunity to test possible dark energy
		  clumping or coupling between dark energy and dark matter.
		  If we can measure galaxy bias in addition, simultaneous
		  measurement of both the overdensity and velocity fields can
		  be used to test the validity of equivalence principle,
		  through the continuity equation.},

	Abstract = {For higher-derivative f( R) gravity, where R is the Ricci
		  scalar, a class of models is proposed, which produce viable
		  cosmology different from the ACDM at recent times and
		  satisfy cosmological, Solar System, and laboratory tests.
		  These models have both flat and de Sitter spacetimes as
		  particular solutions in the absence of matter. Thus, a
		  cosmological constant is zero in a flat spacetime, but
		  appears effectively in a curved one for sufficiently large
		  R. A ``smoking gun'' for these models would be a small
		  discrepancy in the values of the slope of the primordial
		  perturbation power spectrum determined from galaxy surveys
		  and CMB fluctuations. On the other hand, a new problem for
		  dark energy models based on f( R) gravity is pointed out,
		  which is connected with the possible overproduction of new
		  massive scalar particles (scalarons) arising in this theory
		  in the very early Universe.},

	Abstract = {We apply the Wiener Hermite (WH) expansion to the
		  nonlinear evolution of the large-scale structure and obtain
		  an approximate expression for the matter power spectrum in
		  the full order of the expansion. This method allows us to
		  expand any random function in terms of an orthonormal basis
		  in the space of random functions in such a way that the
		  first order of the expansion expresses the Gaussian
		  distribution, and others are the deviations from
		  Gaussianity. It is proved that the WH expansion is
		  mathematically equivalent to the Gamma-expansion approach
		  in the renormalized perturbation theory (RPT). While
		  exponential behavior in the high-k limit has been proved
		  for the mass density and velocity fluctuations of dark
		  matter in the RPT, we prove the behavior again in the
		  context of the WH expansion using the result of the
		  standard perturbation theory (SPT). We propose a new
		  approximate expression for the matter power spectrum which
		  interpolates the low-k expression corresponding to the
		  1-loop level in SPT and the high-k expression obtained by
		  taking a high-k limit of the WH expansion. The validity of
		  our prescription is specifically verified by comparing with
		  the 2-loop solutions of the SPT. The proposed power
		  spectrum agrees with the result of the N-body simulation
		  with accuracy better than 1% or 2% in a range of baryon
		  acoustic oscillation scales, where the wave number is about
		  k = 0.2-0.4 h Mpc-1 at z = 0.5-3.0. This accuracy is
		  comparable to or slightly less than the ones in the closure
		  theory, the fractional difference of which from the N-body
		  result is within 1%. One merit of our method is that the
		  computational time is very short because only single and
		  double integrals are involved in our solution.},

	Abstract = {We study the non-linear behavior of the baryon acoustic
		  oscillation in the power spectrum and the correlation
		  function by decomposing the dark matter perturbations into
		  the short- and long-wavelength modes. The evolution of the
		  dark matter fluctuations can be described as a global
		  coordinate transformation caused by the long-wavelength
		  displacement vector acting on short-wavelength matter
		  perturbation undergoing non-linear growth. Using this
		  feature, we investigate the well known cancellation of the
		  high-k solutions in the standard perturbation theory. While
		  the standard perturbation theory naturally satisfies the
		  cancellation of the high-k solutions, some of the recently
		  proposed improved perturbation theories do not guarantee
		  the cancellation. We show that this cancellation clarifies
		  the success of the standard perturbation theory at the
		  2-loop order in describing the amplitude of the non-linear
		  power spectrum even at high-k regions. We propose an
		  extension of the standard 2-loop level perturbation theory
		  model of the non-linear power spectrum that more accurately
		  models the non-linear evolution of the baryon acoustic
		  oscillation than the standard perturbation theory. The
		  model consists of simple and intuitive parts: the
		  non-linear evolution of the smoothed power spectrum without
		  the baryon acoustic oscillations and the non-linear
		  evolution of the baryon acoustic oscillations due to the
		  large-scale velocity of dark matter and due to the
		  gravitational attraction between dark matter particles. Our
		  extended model predicts the smoothing parameter of the
		  baryon acoustic oscillation peak at z = 0.35 as ~ 7.7Mpc/h
		  and describes the small non-linear shift in the peak
		  position due to the galaxy random motions.},

	Abstract = {We use 5000 cosmological N-body simulations of 1 h -3 Gpc3
		  box for the concordance LambdaCDM model in order to study
		  the sampling variances of a nonlinear matter power
		  spectrum. We show that the non-Gaussian errors can be
		  important even on large length scales relevant for baryon
		  acoustic oscillations (BAOs). Our findings are the
		  following: (1) the non-Gaussian errors degrade the
		  cumulative signal-to-noise ratios (S/Ns) for the power
		  spectrum amplitude by up to a factor of 2 and 4 for
		  redshifts z = 1 and 0, respectively; (2) there is little
		  information on the power spectrum amplitudes in the
		  quasi-nonlinear regime, confirming the previous results;
		  (3) the distribution of power spectrum estimators at BAO
		  scales, among the realizations, is well approximated by a
		  Gaussian distribution with variance that is given by the
		  diagonal covariance component. (4) For the redshift-space
		  power spectrum, the degradation in S/N by non-Gaussian
		  errors is mitigated due to nonlinear redshift distortions;
		  (5) for an actual galaxy survey, the additional shot noise
		  contamination compromises the cosmological information
		  inherent in the galaxy power spectrum, but also mitigates
		  the impact of non-Gaussian errors. The S/N is degraded by
		  up to 30% for a Wide-Field Fiber-Fed Optical Multi-Object
		  Spectrograph-type survey; (6) the finite survey volume
		  causes additional non-Gaussian errors via the correlations
		  of long-wavelength fluctuations with the fluctuations we
		  want to measure, further degrading the S/N values by about
		  30% even at high redshift z = 3.},

	Abstract = {We propose a physical model for nonlinear stochastic
		  biasing of one-point statistics resulting from the
		  formation epoch distribution of dark halos. In contrast to
		  previous works based on extensive numerical simulations,
		  our model provides for the first time an analytic
		  expression for the joint probability function.
		  Specifically, we derive the joint probability function of
		  halo and mass density contrasts from the extended
		  Press-Schechter theory. Since this function is derived in
		  the framework of the standard gravitational instability
		  theory assuming the random Gaussianity of the primordial
		  density field alone, we expect that the basic features of
		  the nonlinear and stochastic biasing predicted from our
		  model are fairly generic. As representative examples, we
		  compute the various biasing parameters in cold dark matter
		  models as a function of a redshift and a smoothing length.
		  Our major findings are that (1) the biasing of the variance
		  evolves strongly as redshift, while its scale dependence is
		  generally weak, and a simple linear biasing model provides
		  a reasonable approximation at roughly R>~2(1+z) h-1 Mpc;
		  and (2) the stochasticity exhibits moderate scale
		  dependence, especially on R<~20 h-1 Mpc, but is almost
		  independent of z. Comparison with the previous numerical
		  simulations shows good agreement with the above behavior,
		  indicating that the nonlinear and stochastic nature of the
		  halo biasing can be essentially understood by taking into
		  account the distribution of the halo mass and the formation
		  epoch.},

		  able to provide a consistent prediction for both power
		  spectra and correlation functions. These results are
		  compared with N-body simulations with which a very good
		  agreement is found up to the quadrupole moment. However,
		  the theoretical predictions for the hexadecapole moment of
		  the power spectra are found to significantly depart from
		  the numerical results at low redshift. We examine this
		  issue and find it to be likely related to an improper
		  modeling of the redshift-space distortions damping effects
		  on which this moment shows large dependence.},

	Abstract = {We present a specific prescription for the calculation of
		  cosmological power spectra, exploited here at two-loop
		  order in perturbation theory, based on the multipoint
		  propagator expansion. In this approach, density and
		  velocity power spectra are constructed from the regularized
		  expressions of the propagators that reproduce both the
		  resummed behavior in the high-k limit and the standard
		  perturbation theory results at low k. With the help of
		  N-body simulations, we particularly focus on the density
		  field, and show that such a construction gives robust and
		  accurate predictions for both the density power spectrum
		  and the correlation function at percent level in the weakly
		  nonlinear regime. We then present an algorithm that allows
		  accelerated evaluations of all the required diagrams by
		  reducing the computational tasks to one-dimensional
		  integrals. This is achieved by means of precomputed kernel
		  sets defined for appropriately chosen fiducial models. The
		  computational time for two-loop results is then reduced
		  from a few minutes, with the direct method, to a few
		  seconds with the fast one. The robustness and applicability
		  of this method are tested against the power spectrum cosmic
		  emulator from which a wide variety of cosmological models
		  can be explored. The Fortran program with which direct and
		  fast calculations of density power spectra can be done,
		  RegPT, is publicly released as part of this paper.},

        11. For a volume-limited luminous red galaxy sample in the
        redshift range of 0.48 \&lt; z \&lt; 0.55, we perform halo
        occupation distribution modelling of the small- and
        intermediate-scale (0.1-60 h$^{-1}$ Mpc) projected and redshift-
        space two-point correlation functions, with an accurate model
        built on high-resolution N-body simulations. To interpret the

        velocities must differ from that of the dark matter inside
        haloes of\CID{1}{}10$^{13}$-{}10$^{14}$ h$^{-1}$ M$_{\UTF{2609}}$, i.e. the
        data require the existence of galaxy velocity bias. Most
        notably, central galaxies on average are not at rest with
        respect to the core of their host haloes, but rather move around
        it with a 1D velocity dispersion of 0.22\^\{+0.03\}\_\{-0.04\}
        times that of the dark matter, implying a spatial offset from
        the centre at the level of {\ensuremath{\lesssim}}1 per cent of

        more slowly than the dark matter, with velocities

        suggests that the velocity and spatial distributions of these
        satellites cannot both be unbiased. The constraints mainly arise
        from the Fingers-of-God effect at non-linear scales and the
        smoothing to the Kaiser effect in the translinear regime; the
        robustness of the results is demonstrated by a variety of tests.

        surveys offer an attractive method for measuring the build-up of
        cosmological structure, which depends both on the expansion rate
        of the Universe and on our theory of gravity. The statistical
        precision with which redshift-space distortions can now be
        measured demands better control of our theoretical systematic
        errors. While many recent studies focus on understanding dark
        matter clustering in redshift space, galaxies occupy special
        places in the universe: dark matter haloes. In our detailed
        study of halo clustering and velocity statistics in 67.5
        h$^{-3}$ Gpc$^{3}$ of N-body simulations, we uncover a complex
        dependence of redshift-space clustering on halo bias. We
        identify two distinct corrections which affect the halo
        redshift-space correlation function on quasi-linear scales
        \CID{9}30-80 h$^{-1}$ Mpc): the non-linear mapping between real-space
        and redshift-space positions, and the non-linear suppression of
        power in the velocity divergence field. We model the first non-
        perturbatively using the scale-dependent Gaussian streaming
        model, which we show is accurate at the \&lt;0.5 (2) per cent
        level in transforming real-space clustering and velocity
        statistics into redshift space on scales s \&gt; 10 (s \&gt; 25)
        h$^{-1}$ Mpc for the monopole (quadrupole) halo correlation
        functions. The dominant correction to the Kaiser limit in this
        model scales like b$^{3}$. We use standard perturbation theory
        to predict the real-space pairwise halo velocity statistics. Our
        fully analytic model is accurate at the 2 per cent level only on
        scales s \&gt; 40 h$^{-1}$ Mpc for the range of halo masses we
        studied (with b= 1.4-2.8). We find that recent models of halo
        redshift-space clustering that neglect the corrections from the
        bispectrum and higher order terms from the non-linear real-space
        to redshift-space mapping will not have the accuracy required
        for current and future observational analyses. Finally, we note
        that our simulation results confirm the essential but non-
        trivial assumption that on large scales, the bias inferred from
        the real-space clustering of haloes is the same as the one that
        determines their pairwise infall velocity amplitude at the per
        cent level.}",

	Abstract = {We develop a path-integral formalism to study the
		  formation of large-scale structures in the universe.
		  Starting from the equations of motion of hydrodynamics
		  (single-stream approximation) we derive the action which
		  describes the statistical properties of the density and
		  velocity fields for Gaussian initial conditions. Then, we
		  present large-N expansions (associated with a
		  generalization to N fields or with a semi-classical
		  expansion) of the path-integral defined by this action.
		  This provides a systematic expansion for two-point
		  functions such as the response function and the usual
		  two-point correlation. We present the results of two such
		  expansions (and related variants) at one-loop order for a
		  SCDM and a LambdaCDM cosmology. We find that the response
		  function exhibits fast oscillations in the non-linear
		  regime with an amplitude which either follows the linear
		  prediction (for the direct steepest-descent scheme) or
		  decays (for the 2PI effective action scheme). On the other
		  hand, the correlation function agrees with the standard
		  one-loop result in the quasi-linear regime and remains
		  well-behaved in the highly non-linear regime. This suggests
		  that these large-N expansions could provide a good
		  framework to study the dynamics of gravitational clustering
		  in the non-linear regime. Moreover, the use of various
		  expansion schemes allows one to estimate their range of
		  validity without the need of N-body simulations and could
		  provide a better accuracy in the weakly non-linear
		  regime.},

	Abstract = {Aims: We study the effect of nonperturbative corrections
		  associated with the behavior of particles after shell
		  crossing on the matter power spectrum. We compare their
		  amplitude with the perturbative terms that can be obtained
		  within the fluid description of the system, to estimate the
		  range of scales where such perturbative approaches are
		  relevant. Methods: We use the simple Zeldovich dynamics as
		  a benchmark, as it allows the exact computation of the full
		  nonlinear power spectrum and of perturbative terms at all
		  orders. Then, we introduce a "sticky model" that coincides
		  with the Zeldovich dynamics before shell crossing but shows
		  a different behavior afterwards. Thus, their power spectra
		  only differ in their nonperturbative terms. We consider
		  both the real-space and redshift-space power spectra.
		  Results: We find that the potential of perturbative schemes
		  is greater at higher redshift for a LambdaCDM cosmology.
		  For the real-space power spectrum, one can go up to order
		  66 of perturbation theory at z = 3, and to order 9 at z =
		  0, before the nonperturbative correction surpasses the
		  perturbative correction of that order. This allows us to
		  increase the upper bound on k where systematic theoretical
		  predictions may be obtained by perturbative schemes, beyond
		  the linear regime, by a factor ~26 at z = 3 and ~6.5 at z =
		  0. This provides a strong motivation to study perturbative
		  resummation schemes, especially at high redshifts z >= 1.
		  In the context of cosmological reconstruction methods, the
		  Monge-Amp{\`e}re-Kantorovich scheme appears to be close to
		  optimal at z = 0. There also seems to be little room for
		  improvement over current reconstruction methods of the
		  baryon acoustic oscillations at z = 0. This can be
		  understood from the small number of perturbative terms that
		  are relevant at z = 0, before nonperturbative corrections
		  dominate. We also point out that the rise of the power
		  spectrum on the transition scale to the nonlinear regime
		  strongly depends on the behavior of the system after shell
		  crossing. We find similar results for the redshift-space
		  power spectrum, with characteristic wavenumbers that are
		  shifted to lower values as redshift-space distortions
		  amplify higher order terms of the perturbative expansions
		  while decreasing the resummed nonlinear power at high k.},

	Abstract = {We present measurements of the angular diameter distance
		  DA(z) and the Hubble parameter H(z) at z = 0.35 using the
		  anisotropy of the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) signal
		  measured in the galaxy clustering distribution of the Sloan
		  Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 7 (DR7) luminous red
		  galaxy (LRG) sample. Our work is the first to apply
		  density-field reconstruction to an anisotropic analysis of
		  the acoustic peak. Reconstruction partially removes the
		  effects of non-linear evolution and redshift-space
		  distortions in order to sharpen the acoustic signal. We
		  present the theoretical framework behind the anisotropic
		  BAO signal and give a detailed account of the fitting model
		  we use to extract this signal from the data. Our method
		  focuses only on the acoustic peak anisotropy, rather than
		  the more model-dependent anisotropic information from the
		  broad-band power. We test the robustness of our analysis
		  methods on 160 Large Suite of Dark Matter Simulation DR7
		  mock catalogues and find that our models are unbiased at
		  the ??0.2 per cent level in measuring the BAO anisotropy.
		  After reconstruction we measure DA(z = 0.35) = 1050 $\pm$
		  38 Mpc and H(z = 0.35) = 84.4 $\pm$ 7.0 km s-1 Mpc-1
		  assuming a sound horizon of rs = 152.76 Mpc. Note that
		  these measurements are correlated with a correlation
		  coefficient of 0.57. This represents a factor of 1.4
		  improvement in the error on DA relative to the
		  pre-reconstruction case; a factor of 1.2 improvement is
		  seen for H.},

	Abstract = {We perform an extensive analysis of nonlinear and
		  stochastic biasing of galaxies and dark halos in a
		  spatially flat, low-density cold dark matter universe
		  (Omega0=0.3, lambda0=0.7, h=0.7, and sigma8=1) using
		  cosmological hydrodynamic simulations. We identify galaxies
		  by linking cold and dense gas particles that satisfy the
		  Jeans criterion. We compare their biasing properties with
		  the predictions of an analytic halo biasing model. Dark
		  halos in our simulations exhibit reasonable agreement with
		  the predictions only on scales larger than ~10 h-1 Mpc; on
		  smaller scales, the volume exclusion effect of halos due to
		  their finite size becomes substantial. Interestingly, the
		  biasing properties of galaxies are better described by
		  extrapolating the halo biasing model predictions. The
		  clustering amplitudes of galaxies are almost independent of
		  the redshift between z=0 and 3, as reported in previous
		  simulations. This in turn leads to a rapidly evolving
		  biasing factor; we find that bcov~=1 at redshift z~=0 and
		  bcov~=3-4 at z=3, where bcov is a biasing parameter defined
		  from the linear regression of galaxy and dark matter
		  density fields. Those values are consistent with the
		  observed clustering of Lyman break galaxies. We also find
		  the clear dependence of galaxy biasing on formation epoch;
		  the distribution of old populations of galaxies tightly
		  correlates with the underlying mass density field while
		  that of young populations is slightly more stochastic and
		  antibiased relative to dark matter. The amplitude of the
		  two-point correlation function of old populations is about
		  3 times larger than that of young populations. Furthermore,
		  the old population of galaxies resides within massive dark
		  halos while the young galaxies are preferentially formed in
		  smaller dark halos. Assuming that the observed early- and
		  late-type galaxies correspond to the simulated old and
		  young populations of galaxies, respectively, all of these
		  segregations of galaxies are consistent with observational
		  ones for early- and late-type galaxies such as, e.g., the
		  morphology-density relation of galaxies.},
